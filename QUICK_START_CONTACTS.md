## 🔍 KEY ALGORITHMS

### Surname Matching
```
Smith vs Smyth = 85% match ✓ (Levenshtein distance)
```

### Address Matching
```
"123 Main, New York, NY" vs "456 Park, New York, NY" 
= Same city "New York" = Match ✓
```

### Email Matching
```
"John@Gmail.COM" vs "john@gmail.com" 
= Normalized to "john@gmail.com" = Match ✓
```

### Phone Matching
```
"(555) 123-4567" vs "555-123-4567" vs "5551234567"
= All become "5551234567" = Match ✓
```

---

## 🧮 CONFIDENCE SCORING

```
Email match       = 40 points
Phone match       = 35 points
Name match        = 25 points
Address match     = 20 points
                  ─────────────
Threshold         = 50 points minimum
Maximum           = 100 points
```

Example:
```
Email match (40) + Phone doesn't match (0) = 40 points
Name 85% similar (25) = 65 points total ✓ MATCH
```
