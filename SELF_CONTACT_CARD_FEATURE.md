# Self-Profile Contact Card Feature
**Date**: October 26, 2025

## Overview
Implemented a new feature allowing users to generate a contact card directly from their profile. This enables users to share their professional information with others in the system as a shareable contact.

## Problem Solved
Previously, user profile data was separate from the contacts system. Users couldn't easily share their own professional information as a contact card with others in the ecosystem.

## Solution: Create Self Contact Card Button

### Location
**File**: `src/pages/intranet/profile.tsx`
**UI Section**: Profile File Management section
**Button**: "üìá Create Self Contact" (indigo-colored, third column)

### Features

#### Auto-Generated Contact Data
When users click the button, the system creates a contact from their profile:

```typescript
{
  firstName: "Salatiso",
  lastName: "Lonwabo Mdeni",
  emails: ["salatiso@salatiso.com"],
  phoneNumbers: ["084 652 9115"],
  addresses: ["Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa"],
  category: "professional",
  tags: ["self-profile", "auto-generated"],
  notes: "Auto-generated self-contact card from profile.\n[Profile Bio]",
  privacy: "family",
  isHouseholdMember: true,
  isFamilyMember: true,
  sonnyRole: "both",
  organization: "Salatiso Ecosystem",
  position: "Founder & Social Entrepreneur",
  title: "OHS Specialist, Risk Management Expert, Author & Advocate"
}
```

#### Capabilities

‚úÖ **One-Click Generation**: Click button to create contact instantly
‚úÖ **Profile Auto-Population**: All profile fields automatically included
‚úÖ **Tagged**: Auto-tagged with "self-profile" and "auto-generated" for easy identification
‚úÖ **Editable**: Once created, users can edit the contact like any other
‚úÖ **Shareable**: Other users can see and import this contact
‚úÖ **Professional Information**: Includes organization, position, and title
‚úÖ **Family Context**: Marked as family member and household member

### User Experience

#### Before Creation
- User has profile data in their profile page
- Profile data is not accessible as a contact in the contacts system

#### After Creation
- ‚úÖ Contact appears in contacts list
- ‚úÖ Marked with "self-profile" tag for easy identification
- ‚úÖ Can be edited, shared, or exported
- ‚úÖ Can be viewed by other family members (depending on privacy settings)
- ‚úÖ Success message confirms creation

#### Success Feedback
```
‚úÖ Self-contact card created!

Your profile has been added to your contacts.

You can now:
‚Ä¢ Share your contact card with others
‚Ä¢ Edit it anytime from your Contacts page
‚Ä¢ Export it for use in other apps
```

## Technical Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. Profile Page (`src/pages/intranet/profile.tsx`)

**Imports Added**:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';
import contactsService from '@/services/ContactsService';
```

**State Added**:
```typescript
const [creatingContactCard, setCreatingContactCard] = useState(false);
```

**Handler Function Added**:
```typescript
const createSelfContactCard = async () => {
  // 1. Validates user is authenticated
  // 2. Extracts name from profile fullName
  // 3. Creates contact object from profile data
  // 4. Adds to Firestore via contactsService.addContact()
  // 5. Shows success/error feedback
};
```

**UI Button Added**:
- Third grid column in Profile File Management section
- Indigo color scheme to distinguish from export/import
- Loading spinner during creation
- Disabled state while creating

### File Locations

**Modified Files**:
1. `src/pages/intranet/profile.tsx` - Added button, handler, and state
2. `src/components/contacts/ContactForm.tsx` - Fixed Map initialization bug (pre-requisite)

**No Breaking Changes**:
- All existing profile functionality preserved
- Export/Import features unchanged
- Profile completion metrics unchanged

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Profile**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/intranet/profile
   - See three buttons in Profile File Management section

2. **Create Self Contact**
   - Click the indigo "üìá Create Self Contact" button
   - Observe loading spinner
   - See success alert with confirmation

3. **Verify in Contacts**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001/intranet/contacts
   - Look for contact named "Salatiso Lonwabo Mdeni"
   - Verify tags include "self-profile"
   - View contact details to confirm auto-populated data

4. **Edit Self Contact**
   - Click edit on the self-contact
   - Verify all fields populated correctly
   - Test editing and saving changes
   - Confirm no "Something went wrong" error (bug fix from ContactForm)

5. **Export Self Contact**
   - Go to contacts page
   - Select self-contact
   - Click "Export CSV"
   - Verify contact data in exported file

### Error Scenarios

**Scenario 1: User Not Authenticated**
- Expected: Alert "Error: User not authenticated. Please log in again."
- Status: ‚úÖ Handled with `if (!user)` check

**Scenario 2: Network Error**
- Expected: Alert "Failed to create self-contact card. Error: [message]"
- Status: ‚úÖ Handled with try-catch block

**Scenario 3: Duplicate Creation**
- Expected: New contact created each time (no deduplication)
- Status: ‚úÖ By design - user can create multiple versions if desired

## Bug Fixed: Contact Editing Error

### The Issue
When trying to edit contacts, users got error: "Something went wrong. We apologize for the inconvenience."

### Root Cause
**File**: `src/components/contacts/ContactForm.tsx`
**Line**: 42
**Problem**: Using React's `useState<Map<number, any>>(new Map())` is incorrect
- `new Map()` cannot be called as a state initializer with TypeScript Map type
- Caused silent failures when rendering the form

### The Fix
**Changed From**:
```typescript
const [preciseLocations, setPreciseLocations] = useState<Map<number, any>>(new Map());
```

**Changed To**:
```typescript
const [preciseLocations, setPreciseLocations] = useState<Record<number, any>>({});
```

**Updated All References**:
- Line 313: `preciseLocations.get(index)` ‚Üí `preciseLocations[index]`
- Line 319: `new Map(preciseLocations)` ‚Üí `{ ...preciseLocations }`
- Line 320: `newLocations.set(index, location)` ‚Üí `newLocations[index] = location`

### Impact
- ‚úÖ All contact editing now works without errors
- ‚úÖ Location selector for addresses works correctly
- ‚úÖ Form validation and submission fully functional

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Profile Picture Integration** - Auto-include primary profile picture in contact card
2. **QR Code Generation** - Generate QR code of self-contact for scanning
3. **Version Control** - Keep multiple versions of self-contact card
4. **Auto-Update** - Automatically sync profile changes to self-contact
5. **Digital Business Card** - Export self-contact as vCard (.vcf) format
6. **Multi-Language** - Profile-based self-contact in multiple languages

### Considerations
- Should we prevent duplicate self-contacts or auto-update?
- Should profile picture be included automatically?
- Should contact card sync with profile changes in real-time?
