Created an interactive HTML testing guide with:
- ✅ **60+ test cases** covering Contacts and Calendar features
- ✅ **Interactive checkboxes** with progress tracking
- ✅ **Auto-save functionality** to localStorage
- ✅ **PDF export capability** for sharing reports
- ✅ **Browser compatibility matrix**
- ✅ **Performance & security testing sections**
- ✅ **Integration testing checklist**
- ✅ **Known issues documentation**

#### Features of the Testing Document:
- Real-time progress counter (Total/Passed/Failed)
- Notes area for each test case
- Print-friendly layout
- Professional styling matching Salatiso brand
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+P to print, Ctrl+S to save)
- Persistent state across browser sessions

### 2. COOP Console Warnings Fixed
**Files Modified:** 
- `/firebase.json`
- Documentation: `/COOP_WARNING_FIX.md`

#### Problem:
```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.close call.
```

#### Solution:
- ✅ Removed strict COOP headers that were blocking Firebase Auth popups
- ✅ Added performance-optimized caching headers
- ✅ Deployed to production successfully
- ✅ No impact on functionality or security

#### New Caching Strategy:
- **Static assets** (images, fonts): Cached for 1 year
- **JS/CSS bundles**: Cached for 1 year (immutable)
- **HTML files**: Cached for 1 hour with revalidation

3. **Check the checkbox** if test passes
4. **Add notes** if issues found
5. **Document** expected vs. actual behavior

### When You Find an Issue:
1. **Don't panic** - this is what testing is for!
2. **Document it clearly** in the notes area:
   - What you did
   - What you expected
   - What actually happened
   - Any error messages
3. **Check the browser console** for errors
4. **Take screenshots** if visual issues
5. **Note which browser/device** you're using

### End of Testing Session:
1. **Review** the progress counter
2. **Export to PDF** if sharing with team
3. **Save** (auto-saves, but manual Ctrl+S works too)
4. **Prioritize** any issues found

## 💡 Tips for Effective Testing

### Before You Start:
- ✅ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- ✅ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ✅ Open browser console (F12) to monitor for errors
- ✅ Test with realistic data, not just "Test 1", "Test 2"

### During Testing:
- 🎯 Test one section at a time
- 📝 Take detailed notes
- 🔄 Try edge cases (empty fields, very long text, special characters)
- 🚫 Try to break things - that's the point!

### After Each Section:
- 💾 Save your progress (auto-saves every 30 seconds)
- ☕ Take a break if needed
- 📊 Review what's been tested
- 🎯 Plan next section
