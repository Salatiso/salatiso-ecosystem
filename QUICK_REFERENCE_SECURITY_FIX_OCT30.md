**Status**: 🟢 **FIXED & DEPLOYED**

## ✅ THE FIX (30 seconds)

**What**: Added authentication gate to all intranet routes

## 🧪 TEST IT (30 seconds)

```
1. Open INCOGNITO browser window

```

---

## 🔧 CLEAR CACHE (2 minutes)

**Chrome/Firefox/Edge**:
1. `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"

    YES ──────→ Show dashboard
```

## 🔐 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Anyone can access | ✅ Login required |
| ❌ No auth gate | ✅ Automatic check |
| ❌ Data exposed | ✅ Protected |
| ❌ No audit log | ✅ Access logged |

---

## 🚨 IF YOU SEE DASHBOARD WITHOUT LOGIN

**This means**: Browser cache still has old version

**Solution**:
1. Clear cache completely
2. Clear service workers
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Close browser
5. Reopen and test again

---

## 💬 CONSOLE OUTPUT

**Logged In**:
```
✅ User authenticated, allowing access: {
  user: "email@example.com",
  role: "founder"
}
```

**Not Logged In**:
```
❌ SECURITY: Unauthorized access attempt to 
protected route: /intranet/projects
```

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Still seeing dashboard in incognito | Clear cache + unregister service worker |
| Login page loops | Check authorized emails list |
| Page says "Verifying authentication..." forever | Refresh page, check console errors |
| "Unauthorized Access" even when logged in | Sign out, clear cookies, sign in again |
