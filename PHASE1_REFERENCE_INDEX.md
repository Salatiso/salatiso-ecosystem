## ⚡ QUICK REFERENCE: WHAT EACH FILE DOES

### EcosystemActivityService.ts
**What it does:**
- Manages activity logging to Firestore
- Sets up real-time listeners
- Caches results
- Filters activities
- Generates statistics

**Main methods:**
```typescript
logActivity(userId, options) → Promise<string>
subscribeToActivities(userId, callback, filters) → Unsubscribe
getRecentActivities(userId, limit, filters) → Promise<Activity[]>
getActivityStats(userId) → Promise<ActivityStats>
triggerSync(userId) → Promise<ActivitySyncResult>
```

**Used by:** EcosystemActivityWidget and any app that logs activities

### EcosystemActivityWidget.tsx
**What it does:**
- Displays activities in real-time
- Provides filtering UI
- Shows statistics
- Enables deep linking
- Manages read/delete

**Two modes:**
- `mode="compact"` → 4 activities in dashboard card
- `mode="full"` → All activities with details and filters

**Used by:** Hub dashboard and will be copied to other apps

### INTEGRATION_GUIDE.ts
**What it does:**
- Shows how to use the service and widget
- Provides copy-paste examples
- Documents activity types per app
- Explains Firestore rules
- Gives checklist

**Used by:** Developers integrating into BizHelp, FinHelp, etc.

## 🔄 ACTIVITY LIFECYCLE

```
1. CREATION (In any app)
   ├─ activityService.logActivity(userId, options)
   ├─ Data written to: /activities/{userId}/items/{activityId}
   └─ Instantly visible in all apps

2. LISTENING (In Hub & other apps)
   ├─ subscribeToActivities() sets up Firestore listener
   ├─ Callback fires when new activity created
   ├─ React component updates (< 500ms)
   └─ User sees activity instantly

3. INTERACTION (User in Hub)
   ├─ Filters activities (by app, category, priority)
   ├─ Marks as read
   ├─ Deletes (soft delete)
   ├─ Clicks to view in source app
   └─ Navigation includes referrer parameter

4. DEEP LINKING (To source app)
   ├─ URL: /bizhelp/projects/123?referrer=ecosystem-activity
   ├─ App receives referrer parameter
   ├─ (Optional) Shows "back to Hub" button
   └─ User can return to Hub with return URL
```

## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS

### Singleton Pattern
The service uses a singleton pattern - there's only ONE instance:
```typescript
const activityService = EcosystemActivityService.getInstance();
```
This ensures consistent state across app.

### Real-Time Listeners
Firestore `onSnapshot()` auto-updates when data changes:
```typescript
subscribeToActivities(userId, (activities) => {
  setActivities(activities) // Updates instantly < 500ms
})
```

### Deep Linking
Activities include URLs to navigate back to source:
```typescript
onClick={() => window.location.href = activity.deepLink}
// Adds referrer: ?referrer=ecosystem-activity&returnUrl=...
```

### Caching Strategy
Results cached for 5 minutes to reduce Firestore reads:
```typescript
// Check cache first
if (cache.has(key)) return cache.get(key);

// If not cached, query Firestore
const results = await query...;

// Cache for 5 minutes
setTimeout(() => cache.delete(key), 5*60*1000);
```

### Throttling
Prevents sync spam with 5-second minimum:
```typescript
const timeSinceLastSync = now - lastSync;
if (timeSinceLastSync < 5000) throw Error('Throttled');
```

---

## 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### Why Singleton?
- Ensures one source of truth for activities
- Prevents duplicate listeners
- Simplifies state management

### Why Real-Time Listeners?
- < 500ms propagation across apps
- No polling (expensive on Firestore quota)
- Always up-to-date

### Why Caching?
- Reduces Firestore read costs
- Faster filtering on cached data
- Improves UI responsiveness

### Why Throttling?
- Prevents accidental Firestore quota overages
- Prevents UI spam
- Reasonable timeout (5 seconds)

### Why Soft Deletes?
- Preserves data for audit trails
- User can recover if needed
- Not truly deleted from database

### Why Two Widget Modes?
- Compact: Dashboard space-efficient
- Full: Detail pages with all features
- Can use same component in different contexts
