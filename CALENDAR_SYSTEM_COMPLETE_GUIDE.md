## üîß FEATURES BREAKDOWN

### 1. Context Filtering
**Use Case**: User wants to see only family events
**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Family" button in ContextSwitcher
2. Selection stored in localStorage
3. Calendar re-subscribes to Firestore with context filter
4. CalendarGrid updates to show only family events
5. Sidebar updates event count

### 2. Event Creation
**Use Case**: User wants to create a new activity
**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Add Event" button
2. EventForm modal opens (advanced mode)
3. User fills in: Title, Description, Date/Time, Category, etc.
4. User optionally assigns roles to attendees
5. User clicks "Create"
6. Service sends to Firestore
7. Real-time subscription receives update
8. CalendarGrid automatically updates

### 3. Event Editing
**Use Case**: User wants to change event details
**How It Works**:
1. User clicks on event in calendar
2. EventDetails modal opens
3. User clicks "Edit" button
4. EventForm modal opens with pre-filled data
5. User modifies fields
6. User clicks "Update"
7. Service updates Firestore
8. Calendar auto-updates via subscription

### 4. Incident Escalation
**Use Case**: High-severity incident needs family attention
**How It Works**:
1. User creates incident with CRITICAL severity
2. Service auto-escalates to family context
3. User can manually escalate by clicking "Escalate"
4. Modal asks for escalation level and reason
5. Service creates escalation entry
6. Incident marked as escalated
7. Higher context members notified (future feature)

### 5. Real-time Updates
**Use Case**: Another family member creates event
**How It Works**:
1. User A opens calendar page
2. Calendar subscribes to Firestore (listens for changes)
3. User B (another family member) creates event
4. Firestore triggers onSnapshot callback
5. CalendarGrid receives new event
6. Calendar automatically updates (no refresh needed)
7. User A sees new event appear on calendar

### 6. Event Linking
**Use Case**: Event is related to specific contact
**How It Works**:
1. User creates event
2. In EventForm, selects "Link to Contact"
3. Service calls `linkToEntity('contact', contactId)`
4. Firestore links event to contact document
5. Contact timeline shows this event
6. Event shows link back to contact

## üîê SECURITY & PERMISSIONS

### Permission Model
```
Owner: Can view, edit, delete, escalate, assign roles
Organizer: Can view, edit, escalate, assign roles
Participant: Can view, escalate
Observer: Can view only
```

### Firestore Rules
- User must be authenticated
- User must have explicit permission in event.roles
- Deleted events are archived (soft delete)
- Audit trail prevents unauthorized access

### Data Privacy
- Events are scoped to user's accessible contexts
- Role array prevents unauthorized viewing
- Firestore rules enforce at database level
- No client-side security (backend enforced)

## üõ†Ô∏è MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Calendar shows no events
**Solution**:
1. Check you're logged in (check top-right user menu)
2. Verify context is selected
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try switching context and back
5. Clear browser cache and refresh

**Issue**: Real-time updates not working
**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Verify Firestore requests are made
4. Check for errors in console
5. Refresh page to restart subscription

**Issue**: Mobile layout broken
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try different browser
4. Check viewport width (should be mobile-responsive)

**Issue**: Event creation fails
**Solution**:
1. Check all required fields filled
2. Verify date is in future (or present)
3. Check console for error message
4. Ensure you have permission to create
5. Try again or contact support

### Monitoring & Logs

**Check Firestore Console**:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project "lifecv-d2724"
3. Go to "Firestore Database"
4. View collections: events, auditLogs, etc.

**Check Browser Console**:
1. Open Dev Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for "[Calendar]" messages
4. Errors will be shown in red

**Check Audit Trail**:
1. Event details shows "Escalation Trail"
2. Audit logs collection in Firestore
3. Shows all actions: created, updated, escalated, etc.

## üìà PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Current Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Firestore pagination (limit 50 events)
- Real-time subscription instead of polling
- Static event color mapping (no re-computation)
- Memoized calendar calculations

### Recommendations for Future
1. Add infinite scroll for events (currently limited to 50)
2. Implement virtual scrolling for large calendars
3. Cache event details locally
4. Batch updates to reduce Firestore calls
5. Add service worker for offline mode
6. Optimize image uploads for event attachments
