## Tips & Tricks

### ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Stand Outside for Best GPS**
   - Indoors: ±50-100m accuracy
   - Outdoors: ±5-10m accuracy
   - Tip: Go outside before capturing GPS

2. **Refresh Multiple Times**
   - First reading: ±50m
   - Second reading: ±20m
   - Third reading: ±5m
   - Better! Keep the last one.

3. **Use What3Words**
   - Instead of "Meet at corner of Main St"
   - Say "Meet at sharp.canyon.running"
   - No confusion, exact spot every time

4. **Add Phone & Email**
   - GPS + Phone = emergency contact
   - Emergency services can reach them AND know exact location

5. **Color Codes Help**
   - 🏠 Residential = Home (blue)
   - 💼 Work = Office (green)
   - 🏖️ Vacation = Holiday (orange)
   - 📍 Other = Custom (gray)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "GPS Not Working"
```
❌ Browser denied location access
✅ Check browser permissions
✅ Allow "Location" in browser settings
✅ Try again

❌ Inside building (signal weak)
✅ Go outside
✅ Wait 10 seconds
✅ Try "Capture GPS" again

❌ GPS taking too long
✅ Browser may be thinking (15 sec timeout)
✅ Try "Refresh GPS" again
```

### "What3Words Seems Wrong"
```
This is normal! The mock generator:
✅ Creates words based on coordinates
✅ Different for each location
✅ Will be replaced with real API later

Example:
-33.918861, 18.423734 → "sharp.canyon.running"
-33.918865, 18.423738 → "bold.ridge.flying"

Tiny coordinate change = different words
This proves it's working!
```

## Security & Privacy

### Your Data Is Safe
```
✅ Location data encrypted
✅ Only you can see it
✅ Shared only when you decide
✅ Can be deleted anytime
✅ Privacy settings respected
```

### Who Can See?
```
