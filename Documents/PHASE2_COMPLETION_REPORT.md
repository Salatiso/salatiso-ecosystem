## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Architecture Pattern
```
UI Layer (Components)
    ↓
React Hooks (State Management)
    ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Firebase Firestore (Data Persistence)
    ↓
Security Rules (Access Control)
```

### Data Flow
```
USER CREATES POLL
→ PollCreationForm validates
→ pollService.createPoll()
→ Firebase stores poll
→ Audit trail created

USER VOTES
→ PollVotingCard captures vote
→ pollService.submitVote()
→ Firebase stores vote
→ Results recalculated

REAL-TIME UPDATES
→ usePolling hook subscribes
→ onSnapshot listeners trigger
→ Results updated
→ UI re-renders (components)
```

### State Management
```typescript
usePolling Hook provides:
- poll: Poll (current poll data)
- results: PollResults (vote tallies)
- userVote: Vote (current user's vote)
- canVote: boolean (permission check)
- timeUntilDeadline: number (countdown)
- votesByOption: Map (vote counts)
- percentagesByOption: Map (vote %)
```
