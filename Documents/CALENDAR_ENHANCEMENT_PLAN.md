# 📅 Calendar Enhancement Plan: Activity & Incident Management System

**Prepared:** October 22, 2025  
**Classification:** Product Development - Feature Enhancement  
**Status:** Strategic Planning Phase  
**Target Launch:** Phase 5B+ (November 2025)  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **strategic enhancement of the existing Calendar module** into a comprehensive **Activity & Incident Management System** that enables:

✅ **Seamless collaboration** across Individual → Family → Community → Professional contexts  
✅ **Role-based workflow management** with permissions and responsibilities  
✅ **Incident tracking** with escalation paths and resolution workflows  
✅ **Participation management** via voting, assistance requests, and support systems  
✅ **Real-time notifications** and mesh-based offline-first alerts  

**Key Principle:** Build on existing functionality. Enhance, never replace. Zero loss of existing calendar features.

---

## Part 1: Strategic Vision & Core Purpose

### 1.1 Mission Statement

Transform the existing Calendar into a **living organizer and safety net** — a comprehensive **Activity & Incident Management System** that:

✅ Organizes individuals, families, communities, and professionals  
✅ Encourages collaboration, assistance-seeking, and participation  
✅ Tracks roles, responsibilities, and outcomes  
✅ Supports both **planned activities** (birthdays, meetings, projects) and **unplanned incidents** (emergencies, safety events)  
✅ Enables seamless transitions from scheduling → activity → meeting hosting → resolution  
✅ Operates across **Individual → Family → Community → Professional** contexts  

---

### 1.2 Current State (Existing Calendar)

**What Works Today:**
- ✅ Basic event scheduling (date, time, title, description)
- ✅ Event display (calendar view, list view)
- ✅ Firebase integration for real-time sync
- ✅ User access and basic permissions
- ✅ Notifications for scheduled events

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No role assignment or collaboration
- ❌ No incident/emergency tracking
- ❌ No voting or decision-making tools
- ❌ No assistance request workflows
- ❌ Limited to "planned" events only (no incident logging)
- ❌ No status tracking or lifecycle management
- ❌ No support/encouragement system
- ❌ No offline-first incident logging
- ❌ No mesh networking alerts

### 1.3 Future State (Enhanced Calendar)

**What We're Building — The Living Organizer:**

**Activity Management Module:**
- ✅ Event creation with context (Individual/Family/Community/Professional)
- ✅ Role assignment (Organizer, Participant, Supporter, Steward)
- ✅ Role-based permissions (edit/view/respond/escalate)
- ✅ Recurring events (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)
- ✅ Activity lifecycle tracking

**Incident Management Module:**
- ✅ Quick incident logging (type, severity, location, description)
- ✅ Categories (Health, Safety, Property, Emotional Support, Other)
- ✅ Escalation workflows (Individual → Family → Community → Professional)
- ✅ Role assignment to responders (First Aider, Safety Officer, Family Steward)
- ✅ Status tracking (Open → In Progress → Resolved → Archived)
- ✅ Resolution notes and linked reports
- ✅ Offline-first logging with automatic sync

**Collaboration Features:**
- ✅ Assistance requests ("Seek Help" button)
- ✅ Voting & polling for decisions and scheduling
- ✅ Encouragement system ("Cheer" / "Support" buttons)
- ✅ Comment threads and chat on events/incidents
- ✅ Real-time notifications (push/email/mesh alerts)
- ✅ Multi-user participation tracking

**Governance & Safety:**
- ✅ Context-aware permissions (Individual → Professional scopes)
- ✅ Audit trails for all actions
- ✅ Compliance reporting for professional context
- ✅ Risk management (escalation paths, responder assignment)
- ✅ Mesh networking integration (Wi-Fi mesh → Bluetooth → Internet fallback)
- ✅ Offline-first architecture (Sonny integration)

**User Experience Evolution:**
- **Today:** "When is the meeting?"
- **Future:** "What's my role? Who needs help? Can I vote? What's the status? Is this safe?"

### 1.4 The Seamless Transition

**From Scheduling to Hosting to Resolution:**

```
PHASE 1: SCHEDULING
└─ Create event
└─ Set context (Individual/Family/Community/Professional)
└─ Assign roles to participants
└─ Create polls for scheduling/decisions
└─ Notify participants

PHASE 2: ACTIVITY EXECUTION
└─ Event occurs
└─ Role-assigned people execute responsibilities
└─ Participants seek help if needed
└─ Live collaboration via comments/updates
└─ Real-time notifications for status changes

PHASE 3: INCIDENT CAPTURE
└─ If incident happens: Quick log within event
└─ Escalate if severity warrants
└─ Assign responders
└─ Track resolution in real-time

PHASE 4: MEETING HOSTING
└─ Execute planned activity
└─ Track participation
└─ Record outcomes
└─ Support those who need help
└─ Celebrate successes

PHASE 5: RESOLUTION & CLOSURE
└─ Mark as resolved
└─ Add resolution notes
└─ Thank participants
└─ Generate reports
└─ Archive for history
└─ Learn from incident (if applicable)

ALL IN ONE SYSTEM — NO CONTEXT SWITCHING
```

## Part 3: Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: Extended Data Model

**Current Calendar Event Structure:**
```typescript
type CalendarEvent = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  dateTime: Date;
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**Enhanced Event Structure:**
```typescript
type EnhancedCalendarEvent = {
  // Existing fields (unchanged)
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  dateTime: Date;
  location?: string;
  
  // NEW: Event Classification
  type: 'activity' | 'incident';
  category: 'meeting' | 'celebration' | 'safety' | 'health' | 'emotional_support' | 'other';
  
  // NEW: Context & Scope
  contextId: string; // individual, family, community, professional
  context: 'individual' | 'family' | 'community' | 'professional';
  
  // NEW: Role Assignment
  roles: Array<{
    userId: string;
    role: 'organizer' | 'participant' | 'supporter' | 'steward';
    permissions: string[]; // 'edit', 'view', 'respond', 'escalate'
    status: 'assigned' | 'accepted' | 'declined' | 'completed';
    assignedAt: Date;
  }>;
  
  // NEW: Incident Tracking
  severity?: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // for incidents
  status: 'planned' | 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'resolved' | 'archived';
  resolutionNotes?: string;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
  resolvedBy?: string;
  
  // NEW: Collaboration
  assistanceRequests: string[]; // userIds requesting help
  assistanceOffered: Array<{
    userId: string;
    status: 'offered' | 'accepted' | 'declined';
  }>;
  
  // NEW: Voting
  polls: Array<{
    id: string;
    question: string;
    options: string[];
    votes: Array<{
      userId: string;
      choice: string;
      timestamp: Date;
    }>;
    deadline: Date;
  }>;
  
  // NEW: Communication
  comments: string[]; // commentIds
  notifications: string[]; // notificationIds
  
  // NEW: Governance
  linkedReports?: string[]; // reportIds

### Feature 3: Incident Logging Form

**Quick Entry Form (Mobile-First):**
```typescript
// src/components/calendar/IncidentLogForm.tsx

type IncidentFormData = {
  type: 'incident';
  category: 'health' | 'safety' | 'property' | 'emotional_support' | 'other';
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  location: string;
  reportedBy: string;
  dateTime: Date;
  context: 'individual' | 'family' | 'community' | 'professional';
};
```

**Form UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚨 INCIDENT LOG                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ Category: [Safety ▼]               │
│ Severity: [High ▼]                 │
│                                     │
│ Title: *________________           │
│ Description: *___________          │
│               ___________          │
│               ___________          │
│                                     │

│ Context: [Family ▼]               │
│                                     │
│ [🚨 CRITICAL ESCALATE]             │
│ [Save & Notify Family]             │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Auto-Escalation Logic:**
```
Critical Severity → Auto-escalate to Family
              ↓
Family → If not resolved in 30 min → Community
              ↓
Community → If not resolved in 2 hrs → Professional
```

## Part 9: Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Breaking existing calendar | Low | High | Extensive testing, feature flags, rollback plan |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Optimization focus, caching, pagination |
| User confusion with new UI | Medium | Medium | Clear onboarding, tutorials, support |
| Data corruption during migration | Low | High | Staging test, backup before launch, rollback ready |
| Mesh integration complexity | High | Medium | Phased rollout, start with WiFi only, add Bluetooth later |

### Contingency Plans

**If Phase 1 has critical issues:**
1. Revert feature flag (disable new features)
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix in staging
4. Test thoroughly
5. Re-enable with caution

**If family testing reveals major design flaw:**
1. Pause that feature
2. Gather detailed feedback
3. Redesign based on input
4. Prototype new approach
5. Re-test before launch
