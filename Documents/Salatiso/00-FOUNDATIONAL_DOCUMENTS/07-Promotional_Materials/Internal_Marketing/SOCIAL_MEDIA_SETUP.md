### **October 9: LifeCV Focus**
**Theme:** "Your Value Story Matters"

#### LinkedIn Article (9:00 AM)
**Title:** "Beyond the Resume: How LifeCV Captures Your Complete Value Story"

**Content:**
In traditional CVs, a teacher's value is measured by years of service and qualifications. But what about the lives they've shaped? The character they've built? The community they've served?

LifeCV changes this. It captures your complete contribution to society - from market-valued skills to the invisible work of care, mentorship, and cultural preservation.

In our Ubuntu worldview: "Umntu ngumntu ngabanye abantu" - your value is measured by how you've served others.

Try LifeCV today and see your complete story. Your worth extends far beyond what any job description can capture.

#LifeCV #Ubuntu #PersonalBranding #CareerDevelopment

#### Twitter Thread (10:00 AM)
```
1/5 üöÄ LifeCV Launch: Your complete value story, Ubuntu-style

Traditional CVs miss so much. They see the job, not the impact. The qualification, not the character. The output, not the care.

2/5 LifeCV captures everything:
‚Ä¢ Professional achievements
‚Ä¢ Household contributions
‚Ä¢ Community service
‚Ä¢ Cultural knowledge transfer
‚Ä¢ Personal growth journeys

3/5 Why? Because "Umntu ngumntu ngabanye abantu" - your value is in how you've served others.

A caregiver's economic impact? Quantified.
A mentor's legacy? Documented.
A community builder's reach? Measured.

4/5 Ready to see your complete story? Visit salatiso.com/lifecv

5/5 What's the most valuable contribution you've made that no CV would capture? #LifeCV #Ubuntu
