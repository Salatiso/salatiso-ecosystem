# Homestead OS Design Prompt

## Design Vision
Create a clean, intuitive operating system interface that embodies Ubuntu philosophy - "I am because we are." The design should prioritize family and personal needs before professional ones, creating a warm, welcoming environment that grows with users through all life stages.

**Homestead Arrival Experience:** You're designing more than an OS—you're crafting a ritual of arrival. Encode the "visit a homestead" journey into the product so users feel guided, grounded, and welcomed from a common gate to each specialized rondavel. Think of each app as a rondavel with a purpose, linked by shared paths and rituals around a central kraal (family hub).

## Core Design Principles

### Family-First Philosophy
- **Color Palette**: Ubuntu-inspired (#6B46C1 deep purple, #D69E2E gold, warm neutrals)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts in multiple South African languages
- **Iconography**: Family-oriented symbols (hearts, homes, trees, people groups)
- **Layout**: Personal dashboard as default, professional tools accessible but secondary

### Life Stage Adaptation
- **Child Mode**: Playful, educational focus with Sazi Life Academy integration
- **Teen/Young Adult**: Social and learning emphasis, career exploration
- **Adult**: Balanced personal/professional, family management tools
- **Elder**: Simplified interface, health and legacy focus

### Intuitive Navigation
- **Dashboard**: Personalized widget-based home screen
- **App Grid**: Organized by life domains (Family, Learning, Work, Health)

- **Search**: Universal search across all apps and data
