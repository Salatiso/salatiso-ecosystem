## Risk Level Assessment

### 🟢 LOW RISK

**Why?**
- New components only (no modifications to existing)
- Existing widgets remain unchanged
- New dashboard isolated in separate folder
- Original dashboard remains as fallback
- Can deploy in parallel (both versions available)
- Easy to rollback if needed

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Performance if widgets re-render excessively → Mitigated with React.memo
- ⚠️ Mobile UX issues → Mitigated with mobile-first design
- ⚠️ User confusion → Mitigated with documentation

---

✅ All 8 widgets work identically to original  
✅ Context switching feels smooth (<700ms)  
✅ Dashboard loads in <2 seconds  
✅ Responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
