# Salatiso Ecosystem - Unified Dashboard Architecture & Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive dashboard design for The Hub (master) and all ecosystem applications  
**Foundation:** Ubuntu principles - "I am because we are"

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SCOPE BOUNDARIES FOR DEVELOPERS

### 🚨 THIS IS A **DASHBOARD-ONLY** SPECIFICATION

**WHAT YOU MUST MODIFY:**
- ✅ Dashboard components ONLY
- ✅ Dashboard widgets ONLY
- ✅ Dashboard layout and grid system ONLY
- ✅ Dashboard context switching mechanism ONLY
- ✅ Dashboard state management ONLY

**WHAT YOU MUST **NEVER** TOUCH:**
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** public landing pages (Home.jsx, About.jsx, etc.)
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** authentication pages (Login.jsx, Register.jsx, etc.)
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** marketing pages or public routes
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** existing app functionality outside dashboard
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** navigation bars, footers, or global layouts UNLESS explicitly part of dashboard header
- ❌ **DO NOT MODIFY** any file that is NOT specifically a dashboard component

### 🎯 SURGICAL MODIFICATIONS ONLY

**If this specification says "dashboard", you modify ONLY dashboard files:**
- `src/components/dashboard/` directory and subdirectories
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` or equivalent dashboard entry point
- Dashboard-specific state management files
- Dashboard-specific utility functions

**ALL EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY MUST REMAIN INTACT:**
- Every feature that currently works MUST continue to work
- Do not remove existing components
- Do not break existing routes
- Do not change existing user flows outside the dashboard

### 📋 PRE-MODIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before making ANY changes, you MUST:
1. ✅ Identify the EXACT files you will modify (list them)
2. ✅ Verify these files are dashboard-specific
3. ✅ Create backups of all files you will touch
4. ✅ Test existing functionality BEFORE making changes
5. ✅ Make changes ONLY to dashboard components
6. ✅ Test that existing functionality still works AFTER changes
7. ✅ Document every file you modified

### 🚫 IF IN DOUBT, DON'T TOUCH IT

**Rule of thumb:** If a file is NOT explicitly mentioned in this specification as a dashboard component, **DO NOT MODIFY IT**.

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a **unified, scalable dashboard architecture** that serves as the foundation for The Hub (master dashboard) and all Salatiso Ecosystem applications. The design achieves seamless transition between personal and professional contexts while maintaining comprehensive integration across all ecosystem platforms.

### Key Innovation: Personal-to-Professional Continuum
Unlike traditional dashboards that force users to choose between personal or business modes, the Salatiso Dashboard employs a **contextual overlay system** that dynamically emphasizes relevant information based on active context while keeping all data accessible.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Document management system
- ✅ 60/40 ownership tracking concept
- ✅ Family governance tools

## 2. Unified Dashboard Architecture

### 2.1. Core Design Philosophy

**"One Dashboard, Multiple Lenses"**

The unified dashboard is a single comprehensive interface that adapts its presentation based on:
1. **User Role:** Child, Teen, Adult, Elder, Administrator, Superuser
2. **Active Context:** Personal, Professional, Family, Community
3. **Current App:** The Hub, LifeSync, BizHelp, SafetyHelp, etc.
4. **Trust Level:** Determines what features/data are visible

### 2.2. Three-Layer Architecture

## 3. Master Dashboard Components (The Hub)

### 3.1. Header Navigation

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo] The Hub              [Search Bar]         [User Avatar ▼] │
│                                                                    │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐          │
│  │ Personal │  │ Business │  │  Family  │  │  Admin   │          │

2. Cloud Function triggers: `onInvoiceCreate`
3. Updates:
   - Hub Dashboard: Business performance widget refreshed
   - FinHelp: Revenue tracking updated
   - LifeCV: Business trust score recalculated
   - Notifications: "Invoice created" sent to relevant parties

1. Certificate issued to: `users/{uid}/learning/saziAcademy/certificates`
2. Cloud Function triggers: `onCourseCompletion`
3. Updates:
   - Hub Dashboard: Learning progress widget updated
   - LifeCV: Education section updated, learning trust score +5
   - MNI Intranet: If family member, descendant eligibility recalculated

## 8. Seamless Personal-to-Professional Transition

### 8.1. Context Overlay System

**Implementation:**
- Dashboard uses **CSS classes** to emphasize/de-emphasize widgets based on context
- All widgets remain visible but with varying opacity/size
- No data is hidden, only presentation changes

**Example:**
```jsx
<WidgetGrid context={activeContext}>
  {/* Personal Finance Widget */}
  <PersonalFinanceWidget 
    className={classNames({
      'col-span-2 opacity-100': activeContext === 'personal',
      'col-span-1 opacity-60': activeContext !== 'personal'
    })}
  />
  
  {/* Business Finance Widget */}
  <BusinessPerformanceWidget 
    className={classNames({
      'col-span-2 opacity-100': activeContext === 'business',
      'col-span-1 opacity-60': activeContext !== 'business'
    })}
  />
</WidgetGrid>
```

### 8.2. Smooth Transition Animation

**UX Flow:**
1. User clicks "Business" context button
2. **Fade out** (200ms): All widgets slightly dim
3. **Reflow** (300ms): Grid layout shifts (business widgets expand, personal widgets shrink)
4. **Fade in** (200ms): New emphasized widgets come to focus
5. **Total transition time: 700ms** (smooth, not jarring)

### 8.3. Preserving User Mental Model

**Key Principle:** User should never feel lost during transition

**Techniques:**
- **Breadcrumb trail:** Show path: "Home > Dashboard > Business Context"
- **Persistent elements:** LifeCV strength and notifications always in same position
- **Visual continuity:** Color scheme adjusts subtly but brand colors remain
- **Undo button:** Quick way to return to previous context

## 10. Implementation Roadmap

### ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION SAFETY RULES

**BEFORE starting ANY phase:**
1. **Backup everything** - Create full backup of existing app
2. **Test baseline** - Document all currently working features
