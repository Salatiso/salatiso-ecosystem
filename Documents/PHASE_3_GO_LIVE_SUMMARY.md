## ✨ WHAT'S NEW IN PHASE 3

### Escalation System - Now Live! 🎯

#### On the Dashboard, You'll See:
1. **Two Tabs:**
   - 📊 **Dashboard** - Original dashboard with all widgets
   - 🚨 **Escalations** - New escalation management system

2. **Escalations Tab Features:**
   - ✅ Create new incidents with "New Incident" button
   - ✅ See all system escalations in real-time
   - ✅ Filter by status: All, Open, Escalated, Resolved
   - ✅ Priority sorting (Critical appears first)
   - ✅ Auto-escalation based on severity
   - ✅ Notifications for critical incidents
   - ✅ Stats dashboard showing counts
   - ✅ Mobile responsive design

#### How It Works:

**Creating an Escalation:**
```
1. Click "Escalations" tab
2. Click "New Incident" button
3. Fill in:
   - Title (what's happening?)
   - Description (details)
   - Location (optional)
   - Severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
4. Submit
5. Instant real-time update for all users
6. Auto-escalation happens based on severity
7. Team gets notifications for critical issues
```

**Severity Auto-Escalation:**
- 🟢 **Low** → Individual level (just logged)
- 🟡 **Medium** → Individual level (family notified)
- 🟠 **High** → Escalates to Family level
- 🔴 **Critical** → Escalates to Professional level (IMMEDIATE)

## 🧪 WHAT TEAM SHOULD TEST

### On Staging: https://lifecv-d2724.web.app/intranet/simple-dashboard

1. **Log in** (use your account or test account)
2. **Click Escalations tab**
3. **Click "New Incident"**
4. **Test each severity level:**
   - Create **Low** incident → Should show OPEN
   - Create **Medium** incident → Should show OPEN + notification
   - Create **High** incident → Should escalate to FAMILY
   - Create **Critical** incident → Should escalate to PROFESSIONAL + alert
5. **Test filtering:**
   - Filter by "All" - see everything
   - Filter by "Open" - see non-escalated
   - Filter by "Escalated" - see critical/high
   - Filter by "Resolved" - see closed ones
6. **Check features:**
   - ✓ Real-time updates (should see new incidents immediately)
   - ✓ Notifications (toast appears for critical)
   - ✓ Priority sorting (critical at top)
   - ✓ Stats dashboard (counts update)
   - ✓ Mobile responsiveness (try on phone/tablet)
   - ✓ Time-ago formatting ("5 minutes ago")
   - ✓ Status colors and icons
