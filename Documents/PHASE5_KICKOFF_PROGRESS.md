- Template metadata (title, progress, participants)

### 4. Implement Consent Flow UI
**File:** `src/components/video/ConsentDialog.tsx` (120 lines est.)
- Ubuntu-themed consent ritual
- Clear explanation of recording purpose
- Visual consent indicator (checkmark when all consented)
- Audit trail display (who consented when)

### 5. Testing & Integration

## 🎨 Design Considerations

### Video UI Principles
1. **Minimalist Controls:** Hide UI during active discussion (auto-fade)
2. **Ubuntu Colors:** Orange/brown accent colors for cultural identity
3. **Elder Visual Hierarchy:** Larger tiles or priority positioning for elders
4. **Consent Visibility:** Always-visible recording indicator when active
5. **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support, high contrast

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Video grid collapses to 1x2 on mobile
- Picture-in-picture for template reference
- Touch-friendly controls (larger buttons)
- Low-bandwidth mode for 3G connections

---

## ⚠️ Important Configuration Required

### Environment Variables Needed
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Daily.co Video Conference
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAILY_DOMAIN=salatiso.daily.co
```

### Daily.co Account Setup
1. Sign up at https://daily.co
2. Create new project "Salatiso Family Councils"
3. Copy API key to environment variables
4. Set custom domain (optional, defaults to random)
5. Configure webhook for recording notifications

### Firebase Storage Setup
- Create `/video-recordings/{sessionId}/` bucket
- Set up access rules (family members only)
- Configure automatic deletion after 30 days (GDPR/POPIA compliance)

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

### Why Daily.co over Jitsi?
- ✅ Better React integration and developer experience
- ✅ Reliable recording with cloud storage
- ✅ Lower latency globally (important for South African users)
- ✅ Free tier sufficient for MVP (10k minutes/month)
- ❌ Tradeoff: Not self-hosted (but can migrate to LiveKit later)

### Why Not WebRTC from Scratch?
- ⏱️ Time: Would take 3-4 weeks vs 1 week with Daily
- 🐛 Complexity: NAT traversal, TURN servers, signaling all handled
- 💰 Cost: TURN server hosting + maintenance > Daily.co cost
- ✅ Quality: Battle-tested at scale

### Recording Consent Architecture
- **Design:** All-or-nothing consent (everyone must consent)
- **Rationale:** Ubuntu principle of collective decision-making
- **Alternative Considered:** Per-participant recording (too complex for MVP)
- **Implementation:** Consent tokens stored in Firestore with signatures

- [ ] 3+ participants can join video call
- [ ] Screen sharing works reliably
- [ ] Recording starts only with full consent
- [ ] Session metrics saved to Firestore
- [ ] Mobile-responsive on Android/iOS

### Performance (Should Have)
- [ ] <3 second room creation time
- [ ] <5 second join time
- [ ] 720p video maintained on 3G+
- [ ] <200ms audio/video sync delay

### Ubuntu Integration (Must Have)
- [ ] Consent flow feels respectful, not bureaucratic
- [ ] Elder participants visually prioritized
- [ ] Recording purpose clearly explained in isiZulu/English
- [ ] Audit trail accessible to all family members

## 👥 Collaboration Notes

### For Future Developers
- **Service Pattern:** VideoConferenceService is singleton, safe to call from multiple components
- **Hook Usage:** Only use `useVideoConference()` once per call session (top-level component)
- **Event Handling:** Service events are fire-and-forget; hook manages state updates
- **Cleanup:** Hook auto-cleans on unmount; explicit `leaveRoom()` call recommended

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** Mock Daily.co client, test service methods independently
2. **Integration Tests:** Use Daily.co test rooms (free), verify E2E flow
3. **Load Tests:** Simulate 12 participants (max family size)
4. **Cultural Review:** Have Mdeni family test Ubuntu features for authenticity

---

## 🎯 Session Summary

**What We Built:** Complete video conferencing foundation (service + hook) with Ubuntu-aligned consent and family council features.

**Lines of Code:** 1,300+ across 3 files (planning, service, hook).

**Dependencies:** Daily.co SDK installed and configured.

**Next Session:** Build FamilyVideoRoom UI component with participant grid, controls, and template sidebar.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 3-4 more sessions (video UI, testing, integration with templates).
