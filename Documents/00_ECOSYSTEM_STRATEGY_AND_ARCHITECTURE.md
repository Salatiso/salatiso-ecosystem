## 📌 Executive Summary

The Salatiso Ecosystem operates on a **"Focused App + Unified Hub"** strategy where:

1. **Individual Apps are LIGHT & FOCUSED**
   - Each app specializes in its core function
   - Minimal profile/registration data stored locally
   - Single source of truth: LifeSync
   - Examples: BizHelp (business), FinHelp (finance), SafetyHelp (safety)

2. **The HUB is 100% COMPREHENSIVE**
   - Master dashboard for all ecosystem activity
   - Shows complete view across all apps
   - Central coordination and decision-making point
   - The "digital homestead center kraal"

3. **LifeSync is the FOUNDATION**
   - Authoritative LifeCV database
   - Trust system headquarters
   - Verification and badge management
   - Updates auto-sync to all apps in real-time

4. **All Apps Show UNIFIED ACTIVITY**
   - Every app shows your full ecosystem activity
   - Real-time updates from all connected apps
   - Deep links to jump to source app for details
   - Context stays with user across all apps

## 🎯 Core Principles

### Principle 1: Focused Excellence
> **"Each app does ONE thing extraordinarily well"**

- **BizHelp:** Business operations, clients, projects (NOT finance, NOT learning)
- **FinHelp:** Financial management, budgets, investments (NOT business operations, NOT learning)
- **SafetyHelp:** Safety protocols, incident tracking, training (NOT financial, NOT business)
- **PigeeBack:** Ride sharing, properties, vehicle management (NOT business, NOT finance)
- **Ekhaya:** Community connections, events, group management (NOT business, NOT learning)
- **Sazi.Life Academy:** Learning paths, certifications, training (NOT business, NOT community)
- **DocHelp:** Document creation, templates, filing (NOT business, NOT financial)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple, fast, laser-focused UI
- ✅ Deep expertise in one domain
- ✅ Easier to maintain and improve
- ✅ Faster performance
- ✅ Clear user mental model

### Principle 2: Hub Omniscience
> **"The Hub sees everything. Individual apps focus on their specialty"**

The Hub combines:
- LifeCV status (from LifeSync)
- Trust system overview (from LifeSync)
- All personal activities (from all apps)
- All business activities (from all apps)
- All community activities (from all apps)
- All financial activities (from all apps)
- All learning activities (from all apps)
- All safety activities (from all apps)

**Users go to Hub for:**
- Comprehensive cross-app view
- Strategic decisions requiring full picture
- Family/business management
- Analytics and reporting
- Settings and integrations

**Users go to individual app for:**
- Deep work in that specialty
- Advanced features for that domain
- Precise data for that app

### Principle 3: LifeSync Supremacy
> **"LifeSync is the DNA of the ecosystem"**

LifeSync alone has authority over:
- Complete user profile (15+ sections)
- Trust score calculations
- Badge and seal management
- Verification workflows
- Personal information

All other apps:
- Display LifeCV status (read-only)
- Link to LifeSync for updates
- Auto-sync when LifeSync changes
- Never create competing profiles

### Principle 4: Unified Experience
> **"Activity follows you across the ecosystem"**

Every app dashboard shows:
- Real-time activity from ALL apps
- Organized by type and time
- Deep links to source app
- Same format across all apps
- Instant visibility of what happened while you were away

**Examples:**
- In BizHelp, you see: "You received $500 in FinHelp", "New SafetyHelp incident reported", "Jane joined your Ekhaya group"
- In FinHelp, you see: "BizHelp project completed", "PigeeBack trip scheduled", "New Sazi course available"
- In any app, you can immediately jump to details in the source app

### Deep Linking from Activities

When you click "[View Details]" on an activity:

**LifeSync Activity:**
```
Current App → LifeSync
URL: https://lifesync-lifecv.web.app/profile?userId={userId}&highlight={updateId}
Effect: Opens LifeSync, shows updated profile section
```

**BizHelp Activity:**
```
Current App → BizHelp
URL: https://bizhelp.salatiso.com/project/{projectId}?highlight=true
Effect: Opens BizHelp, highlights the project
```

**FinHelp Activity:**
```
Current App → FinHelp
URL: https://finhelp.salatiso.com/transaction/{transactionId}?highlight=true
Effect: Opens FinHelp, highlights the transaction
```

(Similar for all other apps)

### Data Flow for Activities

```
User Action in App A
        │
        ▼
   App A detects action
        │
        ▼
   Firestore Activity Collection
   activities/{userId}/{activityId}
   {
     timestamp: Date,
     sourceApp: 'BizHelp',
     activityType: 'project_created',
     activityTitle: 'Project "Website Redesign" created',
     userId: userId,

     data: { projectId: '123', projectName: 'Website Redesign' }
   }
        │
        ▼
   All other apps listening to
   activities/{userId}/* 
   (via onSnapshot listeners)

## 🔗 Deep Linking Strategy

### Deep Link Format

**From Any App to Any Other App:**
```
https://{targetAppDomain}/{path}?referrer={sourceApp}&returnUrl={currentUrl}
```

**Examples:**

From BizHelp to LifeSync:
```
https://lifesync-lifecv.web.app/profile?referrer=bizhelp&returnUrl=https://bizhelp.salatiso.com/projects
```

From FinHelp to BizHelp:
```
https://bizhelp.salatiso.com/projects?referrer=finhelp&returnUrl=https://finhelp.salatiso.com/transactions
```

From Ekhaya to Hub:
```
https://the-hub.salatiso.com/ecosystem-view?referrer=ekhaya&returnUrl=https://ekhaya.salatiso.com/groups
```

### Deep Link Handling

Each app implements a **Return Handler**:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const returnUrl = params.get('returnUrl');
  
  // After user completes action in this app:
  if (returnUrl) {
    // Return to source app
    window.location.href = returnUrl;
  }
}, []);
```

### Navigation Pattern

```
User in App A wants to do something in App B
        │
        ▼
User clicks "View in [App B]" button
        │
        ▼
App A generates deep link with return URL
        │
        ▼
User navigates to App B
        │
        ▼
App B loads and shows requested content
        │
        ├─ If user completes action → Return to App A
        │
        └─ If user closes browser → Return URL is lost
```
