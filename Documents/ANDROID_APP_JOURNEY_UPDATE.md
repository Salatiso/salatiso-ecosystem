# Android App Updates - Human-Centered Narrative
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Version:** Post-Journey Page Alignment  
**Purpose:** Sync Android app journey/about content with web app narrative (65% human, 35% professional)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The web app journey page has been completely rewritten to match the bridge site narrative. The Android app needs the same updates to maintain consistency across all platforms.

**Core Message:**
> "This is not about credentials or corporate achievements. It's about lived experience becoming useful knowledge. It's about a rural boy learning in formal systems, then bringing those skills back home to empower the next generation."
