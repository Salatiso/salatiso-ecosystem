## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT (Next Todos)

### Priority 1: Dashboard Integration (10-15 minutes)
```
□ Create new dashboard tabs for each component:
  - Tab 1: Team Assignment → TeamAssignmentComponent
  - Tab 2: SLA Tracking → SLATrackingComponent
  - Tab 3: Performance Metrics → PerformanceMetricsComponent
  
□ Add tab navigation to simple-dashboard
□ Import all three components
□ Wire up data passing
```

### Priority 2: Notification Trigger Integration (10-15 minutes)
```
□ Connect escalation events to NotificationDeliveryService
□ Wire ESCALATION_CREATED event → notification trigger
□ Wire ESCALATION_ASSIGNED event → notification trigger
□ Wire ESCALATION_ESCALATED event → notification trigger
□ Wire ESCALATION_RESOLVED event → notification trigger
```

### Priority 3: Testing & Deployment (20-30 minutes)
```
□ End-to-end testing of all three components
□ Verify workload tracking in real-time
□ Verify SLA monitoring and alerts
□ Verify performance metrics calculations
□ Deploy to staging
□ Smoke test on staging
```
