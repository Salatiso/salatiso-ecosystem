## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Communication Layer
- **Decision:** Firestore as signaling server for WebRTC
- **Rationale:** Already integrated, real-time, no additional infrastructure
- **Tradeoff:** Slight latency vs dedicated WebSocket server

### 2. Offline Storage
- **Decision:** IndexedDB via native API
- **Rationale:** Browser-native, no dependencies, 100MB+ storage
- **Alternative considered:** LocalStorage (too small), Dexie.js (extra dependency)

### 3. Analytics Storage
- **Decision:** Firestore with aggregated summaries
- **Rationale:** Real-time queries, easy integration, scalable
- **Tradeoff:** Cost vs BigQuery (will migrate at scale)

### 4. AI/ML Approach
- **Decision:** Client-side TensorFlow.js
- **Rationale:** Privacy, instant predictions, no server costs
- **Tradeoff:** Model size vs accuracy (using quantized models)

### 5. Testing Strategy
- **Decision:** Jest + Playwright split
- **Rationale:** Fast unit tests, reliable E2E, industry standard
- **Coverage goal:** 100% (enforced via CI)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

**1. IndexedDB Browser Compatibility**
- **Risk:** Safari Private Mode blocks IndexedDB
- **Mitigation:** Fallback to in-memory queue with localStorage backup

**2. WebRTC Firewall Issues**
- **Risk:** Corporate firewalls block UDP
- **Mitigation:** TURN server fallback (Twilio or Cloudflare)

**3. TensorFlow.js Model Size**
- **Risk:** Large models slow initial load
- **Mitigation:** Lazy load ML features, show loading indicators

**4. Firestore Cost at Scale**
- **Risk:** Analytics writes could exceed budget
- **Mitigation:** Batch writes, aggregate client-side, migrate to BigQuery at 10K+ daily users

### Medium Priority Risks

**5. Mesh Network Scale**
- **Risk:** N-to-N connections don't scale beyond 5 peers
- **Mitigation:** Document limitation, implement super-node architecture if needed

**6. Offline Queue Conflicts**
- **Risk:** Complex conflict resolution edge cases
- **Mitigation:** Manual resolution UI, comprehensive testing
