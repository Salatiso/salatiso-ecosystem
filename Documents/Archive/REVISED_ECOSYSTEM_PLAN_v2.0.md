### 2. Data Model Integration: Mdeni Family

**Real Family Structure (from provided data):**

```
FOUNDATIONAL GENERATION
├─ MN Mdeni (Mlandeli Nelson) [Deceased - Father]
└─ NC Mdeni (Nozukile Cynthia) - Matriarch, 22 Lineata Ave

STEWARD GENERATION (Siblings - Children of MN & NC)
├─ Salatiso - Founder of MNI, Successor, Dual household (22 Lineata + 42 St Switthins, Melville)
│  └─ LS Mkosana (Lukhanyo Sazi) - Son, DOB: 28 Feb 2018, ID: 1802286062086, Dual residence
│
├─ VS Mdeni (Visa Sande) - Sister, DOB: 1985, ID: 8507051036081, 22 Lineata
│  ├─ SM Mdeni (Solonwabo "Solo"/Milile) - Nephew, DOB: 18 Mar 2010, ID: 1003185410084
│  └─ Mila Mdeni - Niece, DOB: 3 Oct 2018
│
├─ TS Mdeni (Tina Sisonke) - Sister, DOB: 1990, 22 Lineata
│  └─ Azora Mdeni - Nephew, DOB: 10 Apr 2021
│
└─ KE Mdeni (Kwakho Eyona) - Sister, DOB: 1990, Separate household
   ├─ MP Mdeni (Milande Paton) - Nephew, DOB: 5 May 2017, ID: 1705266070088, Primarily 22 Lineata
   └─ Milani Mdeni - Niece (Youngest), DOB: 25 Dec 2024

HOUSEHOLDS
├─ Primary: 22 Lineata Ave, Glenvista
│  └─ NC Mdeni, Salatiso, Visa, Tina, Solo, Mila, Azora, Milande
│
├─ Secondary: 42 St Switthins Ave, Melville
│  └─ Sazi (dual with 22 Lineata)
│
└─ Kwakho's Household
   └─ Kwakho + partner, Milani, Milande (primarily 22 Lineata)
```

**Succession Planning (from provided logic):**
- Matriarchal Anchor: NC Mdeni (living steward)
- Stewardship Line: Salatiso (successor, MNI architect)
- Sibling Council: Visa, Tina, Kwakho (governance)
- Next Gen Heirs: Sazi (direct), Solo, Mila, Azora, Milande, Milani (extended via 60% rule)
- Progression: Person → Family → Business (Stewardship flows through MNI governance)

---

### 3. Context Model & Governance

Every record linked to Context IDs:

```
CONTEXT TYPES
├─ Individual (Salatiso's personal LifeCV, Solo's learning path)
├─ Family (Mdeni household shared projects, family governance)
├─ Community (Hiking group, street community, workplace safety)
└─ Professional (MNI activities, roles, compliance)

GOVERNANCE LAYERS
├─ Family: Roles (Viewer, Contributor, Steward, Admin), Permissions, Quorum rules, Charters
├─ Community: Moderation, Trust scores, Reciprocity protocols
└─ Professional: Company roles, Approvals, Audit trails, Compliance

ROLE-BASED ACCESS
├─ Viewer: Read-only
├─ Contributor: Read + create/edit own items
├─ Steward: Read + edit + manage governance
└─ Admin: All permissions

VISIBILITY
├─ Private: Only owner sees
├─ Context: Shared within context (e.g., family members in Family context)
└─ Cross-context: Shared across multiple contexts with explicit permissions
```
