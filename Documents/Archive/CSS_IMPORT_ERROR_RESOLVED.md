# ✅ CSS IMPORT ERROR - RESOLVED

**Issue:** Global CSS import in component-level file  
**Status:** 🟢 FIXED  
**Date:** October 22, 2025

---

## 🔧 What Was the Problem?

Next.js doesn't allow global CSS imports from component files - only from `_app.tsx` or `_document.tsx`.

**Error Message:**
```
Global CSS cannot be imported from files other than your Custom <App>.
Due to the Global nature of stylesheets, and to avoid conflicts, 
Please move all first-party global CSS imports to pages/_app.js
Location: src\components\dashboard\DashboardLayout.tsx
```

---

## ✅ How It Was Fixed

### 1. **Moved CSS Import to _app.tsx**
**File:** `src/pages/_app.tsx`

Added the dashboard CSS import at the top with other global styles:
```typescript
import '@/styles/globals.css'
import '@/styles/print.css'
import '@/components/dashboard/dashboard.css'  // ← ADDED
```

### 2. **Removed CSS Import from Component**
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx`

Removed the problematic import:
```typescript
// REMOVED: import './dashboard.css';
```

## 📝 Technical Notes

**Why This Fix Works:**

Next.js has a specific architecture for CSS:
- **Global CSS** → Must be imported in `_app.tsx` only
- **Component CSS Modules** → Can be imported in any component (use `.module.css`)
- **CSS-in-JS** → Can be used in any component

Our dashboard CSS is global (affects the entire page layout), so it must be in `_app.tsx`.

**Why It Matters:**

This prevents CSS conflicts and ensures predictable style application across the entire application.
