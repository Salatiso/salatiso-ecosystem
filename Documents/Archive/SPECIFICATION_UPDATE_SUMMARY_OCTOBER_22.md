## üéØ Key Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Web App Goes Online-Only

**What This Means:**
```
‚úÖ Web app will NEVER work offline
‚úÖ No IndexedDB, no service worker, no cache
‚ùå Requires internet connection
‚úÖ Simple, clean, maintainable code
‚úÖ Instant updates (no sync delays)
‚úÖ Single source of truth (Firebase)
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- Web users expect internet requirement
- Simplifies codebase significantly
- No offline sync conflicts
- Instant Firebase real-time updates
- No battery drain (browser optimization)

**What Users Get:**
- ‚úÖ Always see latest data
- ‚úÖ Instant collaboration (real-time)
- ‚úÖ No sync conflicts to manage
- ‚úÖ Clean, fast, professional

---

### Decision 2: Native Apps Go Offline-First

**What This Means:**
```
‚úÖ Android/TV/Homestead work completely offline
‚úÖ All data cached in local SQLite
‚úÖ Changes saved immediately (local)
‚úÖ Auto-sync when connected
‚úÖ Push notifications enabled
‚úÖ Background services (geofencing, check-in)
‚úÖ All features work offline & online
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- Mobile users need offline capability
- Field work doesn't have connectivity
- Native apps can handle complexity
- Better performance on resource-constrained devices
- FCM push notifications enable background communication
- Background services enable safety features

**What Users Get:**
- ‚úÖ Works offline (fieldwork, travel)
- ‚úÖ Instant local feedback (no wait)
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync when online
- ‚úÖ Push notifications & alerts
- ‚úÖ Background geofencing & check-in
- ‚úÖ All features work anywhere

---

### Decision 3: Complete Feature Parity (When Online)

**What This Means:**
```
All Platforms (When Online):
‚îú‚îÄ User authentication
‚îú‚îÄ Family management
‚îú‚îÄ Project tracking
‚îú‚îÄ Document management
‚îú‚îÄ Event calendar
‚îú‚îÄ Financial tracking
‚îú‚îÄ Business planning
‚îú‚îÄ Real-time collaboration
‚îú‚îÄ 11-language support
‚îú‚îÄ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
‚îî‚îÄ Audit logging
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- Users get same features everywhere
- Consistent experience across platforms
- Shared business logic (TypeScript)
- Easy to maintain one codebase
- Users can switch platforms without learning new features

## üîÑ Data Sync Strategy

### Web App (No Sync)
```
User ‚Üí Firebase ‚Üê Other Users
(Real-time, no queue, no conflicts)
```

### Native Apps (Smart Sync)
```
User Action
    ‚Üì
Local SQLite (immediate)
    ‚Üì
Online? ‚Üí Firebase ‚úÖ Synced
         ‚Üì
Offline? ‚Üí Queue ‚è≥ Pending
         ‚Üì (Later)
Online? ‚Üí Process Queue ‚úÖ Synced
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security (Identical Across All)

**Authentication:**
- Firebase Auth (email + Google OAuth)
- Same for all platforms

**Authorization:**
- Firestore Rules (same rules everywhere)
- Role-based access (email whitelist)
- Device-agnostic permissions

**Data Encryption:**
- Web: HTTPS in transit
- Native: HTTPS + encrypted local storage

**Audit Trail:**
- All actions logged to Firestore
- Platform tracked (web/android/tv/homestead)
- Sync status recorded

## üìû Questions Answered

**Q: Why not keep offline for web too?**  
A: Complexity vs benefit trade-off. Web users have internet. Mobile users don't always.

**Q: How do we avoid sync conflicts?**  
A: Firestore is source of truth. Timestamps resolve most conflicts. Rare conflicts escalate to user.

**Q: What if web needs offline later?**  
A: Easy to add - architecture supports it. Just add service worker + sync queue layer.

**Q: Can users switch between platforms?**  
A: Yes! Same Firebase auth, same Firestore data. Perfect parity when online.

**Q: What about security?**  
A: Identical Firestore rules everywhere. Platform-specific only for local storage encryption (mobile).

**Q: Can we share code between web and native?**  
A: Yes! All business logic in TypeScript. UI/adapters are platform-specific.
