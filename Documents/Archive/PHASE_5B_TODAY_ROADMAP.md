## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Server not responding
```powershell
# Kill all node processes
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Clear build cache
rm -r 'd:\WebSites\salatiso-ecosystem\Salatiso-React-App\.next' -Force

# Restart dev server
cd 'd:\WebSites\salatiso-ecosystem\Salatiso-React-App'
npm run dev
```

### Getting TypeScript errors in console
- Refresh browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check that you modified next.config.js correctly (static export only in production)
- If errors persist, run `npm run build` to see full errors

### Asset/Calendar pages show blank
- Press F12, check Console for errors
- Verify mock data is loading (should see logs in console)
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Something looks ugly
- This is using mock data and Tailwind CSS, so it should be clean and professional
- Check responsive design (might be a viewport issue)
- Document what looks wrong for feedback
