# ðŸ”§ Google Sign-In Redirect Loop - FIXED

## Issue: Page Blinking & Infinite Loading After Google Sign-In

**Symptom**: After signing in with Google account on `/intranet/login/?redirect=/sonny`, the page continuously blinks and reloads without ever completing the redirect to the target page.

**Root Cause**: The redirect logic had multiple issues:
1. **Multiple redirect calls** - The `router.replace()` was being called repeatedly without guards
2. **Unhandled redirect result** - `getRedirectResult()` was potentially being called multiple times
3. **Stale dependency references** - The useEffect had all dependencies but the redirect could still trigger multiple times

---

## Fixes Applied

### âœ… Fix 1: Added Redirect Guard (login.tsx)
**File**: `src/pages/intranet/login.tsx`

**Change**: Added `useRef` to track if redirect has already been executed
```typescript
// BEFORE (Multiple redirects possible):
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !loading) {
    router.replace(redirectUrl);
  }
}, [user, loading, router, redirectUrl]);

// AFTER (Prevents multiple redirects):
const redirectExecutedRef = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !loading && !redirectExecutedRef.current) {
    redirectExecutedRef.current = true;
    router.push(redirectUrl);
  }
}, [user, loading, redirectUrl]);
```

**Why**: 
- `redirectExecutedRef` ensures redirect only happens once
- Changed from `router.replace()` to `router.push()` for better navigation
- Removed `router` from dependencies to prevent re-runs

### âœ… Fix 2: Handle Redirect Result Once (AuthContext.tsx)
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Change**: Added local flag to prevent multiple `getRedirectResult()` calls
```typescript
// BEFORE (Multiple calls possible):
const handleRedirectResult = async () => {
  const result = await getRedirectResult(auth);
  // ...
};

// AFTER (Called only once):
let redirectHandled = false;
const handleRedirectResult = async () => {
  if (redirectHandled) return;
  redirectHandled = true;
  
  const result = await getRedirectResult(auth);
  // ...
};
```

**Why**: 
- `getRedirectResult()` should only be called once per auth lifecycle
- Multiple calls can cause unexpected behavior
- The flag ensures clean execution

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **User clicks "Sign in with Google"**
   - âœ… Page redirects to Google login
   
2. **User authenticates with Google**
   - âœ… Google redirects back to `/intranet/login/?redirect=/sonny`
   
3. **Firebase processes authentication**
   - âœ… `onAuthStateChanged()` detects new user
   - âœ… User profile is initialized
   - âœ… Loading state is set to false
   
4. **Login page detects authenticated user**
   - âœ… `redirectExecutedRef.current` is `false`
   - âœ… Condition `user && !loading && !redirectExecutedRef.current` is true
   - âœ… Set `redirectExecutedRef.current = true`
   - âœ… Call `router.push(redirectUrl)` exactly once
   
5. **User is navigated to target page**
   - âœ… Redirects to `/sonny` (or the `?redirect=` URL)
   - âœ… No blinking or re-loading
   - âœ… Page loads normally

---

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear browser cache/cookies** (optional but recommended)
   ```
   Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Clear storage
   ```

2. **Navigate to login**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/intranet/login/?redirect=/sonny
   ```

3. **Click "Sign in with Google"**
   - Wait for Google popup

4. **Authenticate with your Google account**
   - Should redirect back automatically

5. **Verify redirect**
   - Should land on `/sonny` page
   - No blinking or infinite loading
   - Console should show "User authenticated, redirecting to: /sonny"

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

**Before (Broken)**:
```
Google Auth â†’ /login Page â†’ useEffect fires â†’ router.replace() â†’ page reloads 
â†’ useEffect fires again â†’ router.replace() â†’ ... (INFINITE LOOP)
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
Google Auth â†’ /login Page â†’ useEffect fires â†’ redirectExecutedRef.current = true 
â†’ router.push() once â†’ Navigates to /sonny â†’ Done (NO LOOP)
```

### Key Improvements

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Redirect calls | Multiple | Single (guarded by ref) |
| Router method | `replace()` (replaces history) | `push()` (adds to history) |
| getRedirectResult() | May be called multiple times | Called once with flag |
| Dependencies | Included router (causes re-runs) | Removed router (cleaner) |
| Result | Infinite redirect loop | Clean single redirect |
