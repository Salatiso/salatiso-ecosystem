## 🔍 Verification Results

### ✅ No ID Conflicts
- Journey page uses unique IDs: `transkei-roots`, `independence-ohs-career`, etc.
- About page doesn't use IDs (uses array index)
- **Result:** No collision possible

### ✅ No Variable Name Conflicts
- Journey: `timelineEvents` (with capital E)
- About: `timeline` (lowercase)
- **Result:** Completely separate variable names

### ✅ No Rendering Conflicts
- Journey: Maps over `timelineEvents`
- About: Maps over `timeline`
- **Result:** Independent rendering logic

### ✅ Content Consistency
Both entries cover the same period (1982-2003) with consistent information:
- Birth year: 1982 ✓
- Parents: Mlandeli & Notemba ✓
- Villages: Mahasana, Lenane, Kiriyatswana ✓
- Themes: Ubuntu, Xhosa heritage, extended family ✓

### ✅ No Style Conflicts
- Journey page: Custom timeline component with icons and categories
- About page: Simpler phase-based layout
- **Result:** Different visual presentations, no CSS conflicts
