## 🎓 DEVELOPER REFERENCE

### Integration Points
```typescript
// Phase 1 + Phase 2 seamlessly integrate via:

✅ Unified Firebase Auth
✅ Same Firestore structure
✅ Shared type system (src/types/)
✅ Common service patterns
✅ Identical component styling
✅ Same security rules framework
✅ Coordinated real-time updates
```

### How They Work Together
```
Calendar Event (Phase 1)
  ├─ Has Roles assigned (Phase 1)
  ├─ Can have Incidents logged (Phase 1)
  ├─ Can have Assistance requests (Phase 1)
  └─ Can have Polls created (Phase 2) ← NEW
  
Poll (Phase 2)
  ├─ Attached to Event
  ├─ Has Questions & Options
  ├─ Collects Votes from Participants
  ├─ Displays Results in Real-Time
  └─ Integrates with Role permissions
```

### Real-Time Architecture
```
Phase 1 Real-Time:
  ├─ useRoleAssignment → onSnapshot listeners
  ├─ useIncidentEscalation → batch updates
  └─ useOffline → offline-first sync

Phase 2 Real-Time:
  ├─ usePolling → onSnapshot listeners
  ├─ Poll changes trigger results recalc
  └─ Countdown timers for deadlines

Combined Effect:
  = Complete real-time event management system
```
