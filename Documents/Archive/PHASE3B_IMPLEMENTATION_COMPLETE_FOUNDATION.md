## 🎓 Technical Details

### Responsive Design Strategy:
1. **Mobile First**: Design starts for mobile (1 column)
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Scales up to tablet (8 cols) then desktop (12 cols)
3. **CSS Grid**: Automatic responsive positioning
4. **No Media Queries for Widgets**: Widgets adapt automatically

### State Management:
- **Provider Pattern**: LayoutProvider wraps entire dashboard
- **Context API**: useLayoutContext hook for state access
- **Firestore**: Preferences persisted and synced across devices
- **Optimistic Updates**: State updates immediately, persists to Firestore

### Performance Optimizations:
- **useMemo**: Widget configs recalculated only on dependency changes
- **CSS Transitions**: Hardware-accelerated animations
- **Lazy Loading**: Widgets only render when visible
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Only affected widgets re-render on context change

### Accessibility:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Level AA compliance for all components
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Readers**: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG contrast requirements
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators
- **Motion**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion setting
