## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### 1. Firestore Index Errors (NON-BLOCKING)
**Location**: Calendar page console  
**Error**: `The query requires an index. You can create it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/...`  
**Root Cause**: ContactsService is trying to query Firestore with composite indexes that don't exist  
**Impact**: Minor - errors in console, but calendar still functions  
**Fix**: Suppress these errors or wait for Firebase index creation (not urgent for local testing)  
**Priority**: LOW (doesn't break functionality)

---

### 2. Month/Week/Day View Toggle Not Implemented
**Location**: Calendar page  
**Expected**: Clicking between Month/Week/Day view options should switch views  
**Actual**: Nothing happens when clicked  
**Root Cause**: Toggle buttons exist in UI but have no onClick handlers  
**Fix**: Implement view state management and conditional rendering  
**Priority**: MEDIUM (feature expectation)

---

### 3. Add Event Button Not Implemented
**Location**: Calendar page  
**Expected**: Clicking "Add Event" button opens form to create new event  
**Actual**: Nothing happens  
**Root Cause**: Button has no onClick handler implemented  
**Fix**: Create event modal/form with field validation  
**Priority**: MEDIUM (feature expectation)

---

### 4. Import/Export Not Implemented
**Location**: Calendar page  
**Expected**: 
- Upload calendar in .ics format (standard calendar interchange format)
- Download calendar as .ics, JSON, CSV
- Support for other calendar formats  
**Actual**: UI elements exist but not functional  
**Root Cause**: Import/export methods in EnhancedCalendarService are stub implementations  
**Fix**: Implement proper ICS parser/generator and export formats  
**Priority**: HIGH (user-facing feature)

---

### 5. Download Functionality Missing Across App
**Location**: All pages  
**Expected**:
- Assets: Download as JSON, CSV, PDF
- Calendar: Download as .ics, JSON, CSV
- Register/Contacts: Download as JSON, CSV, vCard format
**Actual**: No download buttons present  
**Root Cause**: Not yet implemented
