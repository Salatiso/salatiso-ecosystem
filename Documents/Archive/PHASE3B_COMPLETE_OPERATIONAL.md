## 🎓 WHAT WAS LEARNED

### CSS Import in Next.js
- Global CSS must be in `_app.tsx` or `_document.tsx`
- Component-level CSS must use CSS Modules (.module.css)
- This prevents conflicts and ensures predictable styling

### Dashboard Architecture
- Responsive grid system scales from 1 to 12 columns
- Context-aware widget positioning
- Firestore-backed state management
- Clean separation of concerns

### Quality Assurance
- 0 errors = production-ready code
- Comprehensive documentation = easier maintenance
- Testing guides = smoother deployment
