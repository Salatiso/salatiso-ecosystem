## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase 5B represents the **formality establishment phase** of the Salatiso Ecosystem. This is NOT a feature phase—this is a **governance, testing, and alignment phase** that ensures:

1. **MNI (Master Narrative Index) Completeness** - All ecosystem narratives formally documented
2. **Family Alignment** - Family structure properly established and informed
3. **Testing Formality** - Professional 3-tier testing framework with role-based responsibilities

5. **Documentation Completeness** - All specifications recorded before feature rollout

**Key Principle:** "Ensure whole formality is with us first before we roll out features to whole ecosystem"
