## 📝 KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. **Sidebar Reorganization:**
   - Moved Assets & Calendar to PRIMARY (core tier)
   - Kept LifeCV in primary (critical for Phase 5B)
   - Collapsed extended features into "More ▾"
   - This reduces cognitive load and highlights Phase 5B focus

2. **Data Model Scope:**
   - Assets: 20+ fields (covers all asset types + tax compliance)
   - Calendar: 30+ fields (covers all event types + travel safety)
   - Both extensible for future ecosystem features

3. **Service Architecture:**
   - Singleton pattern for services (one instance per service)
   - Interface-based contracts for type safety
   - Firestore-native queries for scalability
   - Batch operations support for family pooling

4. **Mock Data:**
   - Included realistic test data
   - Covers all categories and features
   - Easy to replace with real data
   - Helps with UX testing
