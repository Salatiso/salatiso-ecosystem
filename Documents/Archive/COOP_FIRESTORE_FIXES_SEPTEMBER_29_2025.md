# üîß Firebase Authentication & COOP Issues - RESOLVED

## **Issue Summary**
**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**

### **Problems Encountered:**
1. ‚ùå **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) Errors** - `window.closed call would be blocked`
2. ‚ùå **Firestore Permissions Error** - `Missing or insufficient permissions`

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied**

### **1. Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) Fix**

**Root Cause:** Firebase Auth popup windows being blocked by browser COOP policies

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Updated AuthContext.tsx:**
  - Added `signInWithRedirect` and `getRedirectResult` imports
  - Changed Google login from `signInWithPopup` to `signInWithRedirect`
  - Added redirect result handling in `useEffect`
  - Improved error handling and logging

- **Updated Firebase Hosting Headers:**
  - Added `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`
  - Added `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: unsafe-none`
  - Applied via `firebase.json` configuration

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: signInWithPopup (caused COOP errors)
const result = await signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider);

// After: signInWithRedirect (COOP-compliant)
await signInWithRedirect(auth, googleProvider);
// Handle result after page reload in useEffect
```

### **2. Firestore Permissions Fix**

**Root Cause:** Missing Firestore security rules for user profile operations

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Created `firestore.rules`:**
  - Users can read/write their own profile: `match /users/{userId}`
  - Family members can access family collections
  - Business documents accessible to authorized emails
  - Proper email-based authorization checks

- **Updated `firebase.json`:**
  - Added Firestore configuration
  - Connected security rules file
  - Deployed rules to production

**Security Rules Structure:**
```javascript
// Users can manage their own profiles
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Family collections - authenticated family members only
match /family/{document=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.token.email in [authorized_emails];
}
```
