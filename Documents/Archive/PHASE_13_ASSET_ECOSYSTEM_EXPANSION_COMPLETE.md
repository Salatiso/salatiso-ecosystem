## Component Integration Points

### For assets.tsx Component

**Household Member Dropdown Integration:**
```typescript
import { getAvailablePrimaryUsers } from '@/data/householdMembers';

// In form:
<select value={assetFormData.primaryUser}>
  {getAvailablePrimaryUsers().map(name => (
    <option key={name} value={name}>{name}</option>
  ))}
</select>
```

**Rental Unit Display:**
```typescript
import { rentalUnits, getOccupancyRate } from '@/data/rentalUnits';

// Display occupancy info:
const occupancy = getOccupancyRate();
// Shows: 2/3 occupied = 66.7%
```

**Workshop Equipment Display:**
```typescript
import { workshopEquipment, getTotalWorkshopValue } from '@/data/workshopEquipment';

// Display maintenance alerts:
const needsMaintenance = getItemsNeedingMaintenance();
// Flags cordless grinder as needs-repair
```

**Platform Integration:**
```typescript
import { getRecommendedPlatforms } from '@/types/platformIntegration';

// Smart suggestions for user:
const platforms = getRecommendedPlatforms('equipment', 'lending');
// Returns: ['pigeeback-lending', 'pigeeback-sale']
```

## Service Worker Warning Resolution

**Issue:** "Service Worker registration failed: TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('http://localhost:3000/') with script ('http://localhost:3000/sw.js')"

**Status:** ⚠️ Warning only (non-fatal)

**Cause:** Static export configuration in next.config.js prevents Service Worker registration

**Impact:** None - app functions normally without Service Worker

**Resolution:** Can be ignored in development. In production, can be addressed by removing static export if server-side rendering is enabled.

1. **UI Component:** Display rental unit occupancy dashboard
2. **UI Component:** Workshop equipment availability calendar
