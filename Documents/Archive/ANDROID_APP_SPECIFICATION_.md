This integration enables seamless communication across the entire MNI ecosystem including LifeSync, PigeeBack, SafetyHelp, and BizHelp applications.

**Core Integration Features:**

#### Sonny Bridge Mode
```kotlin
interface SonnyBridgeClient {
    // Connect to LifeSync master device
    suspend fun discoverLifeSyncDevices(): List<MeshPeer>
    suspend fun connectToLifeSync(peerId: String): Result<Connection>
    
    // Sync essential family data via mesh
    suspend fun syncFamilyStatus(): Result<FamilyStatus>
    suspend fun syncTriggerAlerts(): Result<List<TriggerAlert>>
    
    // Lightweight messaging
    suspend fun sendQuickMessage(message: QuickMessage): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun receiveMessages(): Flow<QuickMessage>
}
```

#### Essential Mesh Features (Lite Mode)
- **Family Presence:** See who's online via mesh network
- **Quick Check-ins:** Simple "I'm safe" messages without full LifeSync
- **Emergency Alerts:** Receive critical safety triggers from family members
- **Location Sharing:** Basic location broadcast to nearby family devices
- **Trust Display:** Show trust scores from family ecosystem interactions

#### Hybrid Sync Strategy
```kotlin
// Data sync priority: Mesh first, Internet fallback
class HybridSyncManager {
    suspend fun syncFamilyData(): SyncResult {
        return try {
            // 1. Try mesh sync with LifeSync master device
            meshSync.syncWithLifeSync()
        } catch (meshException) {
            // 2. Fallback to internet sync if available
            internetSync.syncWithFirebase()
        } catch (internetException) {
            // 3. Use cached data with offline indicators
            offlineCache.getLastKnownData()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Consent Integration (Simplified)
```kotlin
interface ConsentManagerLite {
    // Basic consent for family mesh networking
    suspend fun requestMeshConsent(familyMemberId: String): ConsentStatus
    
    // Simple location sharing permission
    suspend fun shareLocationWithFamily(enabled: Boolean): Result<Unit>
    
    // Emergency override (always allowed for family safety)
    suspend fun enableEmergencyMode(): Result<Unit>
}
```

**Integration Scenarios:**

#### Scenario 1: Full Ecosystem Mesh Integration
```
Family Setup:
- Parent has LifeSync (mesh coordinator)  
- Teen has Salatiso app (full ecosystem access)
- Business operations coordinated across all apps
- Devices connected via hybrid mesh network

Workflow:

3. Bridges family enterprise data to cloud services
4. Downloads business updates for entire family network
5. Coordinates cross-ecosystem business operations
```

#### Scenario 3: Offline Enterprise Management
```
Setup:
- Salatiso user managing family business offline
- Complete enterprise functionality without connectivity

Workflow:
1. Access cached family and business data
2. Continue project management and task completion
3. Update business plans and financial tracking offline  
4. Queue all updates and communications for sync
5. Provide complete offline family enterprise dashboard
6. Auto-sync all business data when connectivity returns
```

**Technical Implementation:**

#### Mesh Protocol Adapter
```kotlin
class SonnyLiteAdapter {
    // Lightweight version of full Sonny mesh protocol
    private val meshEngine = SimpleMeshEngine(
        maxHops = 3,           // Reduced from full Sonny
        messageTypes = listOf( // Essential types only
            MessageType.FAMILY_STATUS,
            MessageType.EMERGENCY_ALERT,
            MessageType.QUICK_CHECKIN,
            MessageType.LOCATION_UPDATE
        )
    )
    
    // Simplified message routing
    suspend fun routeMessage(message: LiteMessage): Result<Unit> {
        return when {
            isLifeSyncAvailable() -> routeViaLifeSync(message)
            isInternetAvailable() -> routeViaInternet(message)
            else -> queueForLaterDelivery(message)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Data Model Compatibility
```kotlin
// Shared data models with LifeSync (subset)
data class FamilyStatusLite(
    val memberId: String,
    val displayName: String,
    val lastSeen: Instant,
    val presenceStatus: PresenceStatus, // ONLINE, OFFLINE, MESH_ONLY
    val trustTier: TrustTier,           // From full ecosystem
    val activeTriggersCount: Int,       // Summary only
    val lastLocation: LocationSummary?  // Simplified location
)

data class TriggerAlertLite(
    val triggerId: String,
    val memberName: String,
    val alertLevel: AlertLevel,         // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EMERGENCY  
    val message: String,                // User-friendly summary
    val timestamp: Instant,
    val requiresResponse: Boolean
)
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Reduced mesh message payload (essential data only)
- Aggressive caching of family status for offline use
- Battery-optimized Bluetooth LE scanning intervals
- Background sync limitations to preserve battery life
- Simplified UI rendering for mesh-only mode
