## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Responsive Design Strategy
```css
Mobile (< 768px)    → 1 column layout
Tablet (768-1024px) → 8 column grid
Desktop (1024px+)   → 12 column grid
Large (1280px+)     → Centered max-width
```

### State Management Flow
```
Firestore Database
    ↓
useLayoutContext (Provider)
    ↓
LayoutProvider (Wrapper)
    ↓
UnifiedDashboard (Consumer)
    ↓
Widget Rendering
```

### Context Switching Logic
```
User clicks context button
    ↓
setContext(newContext)
    ↓
State updates immediately (optimistic)
    ↓
Saves to Firestore asynchronously
    ↓
Widgets re-render with new positions
    ↓
Smooth 300ms transition
```
