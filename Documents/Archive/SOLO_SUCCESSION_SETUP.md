## Part 1: Succession Framework & Philosophy

### 1.1 - Why Succession Planning Matters

**The Context:**
The Salatiso Ecosystem represents:
- **ZAR 14.95M in intellectual property assets**
- **146,500+ active users depending on our products**
- **ZAR 1.12M annual revenue streams**
- **7 patents filed and pending protection**
- **3 generations of family potentially affected by leadership changes**

**Without Succession Planning, Risk Emerges:**
- ❌ Unclear authority if Mukurwe becomes unavailable
- ❌ Potential confusion or conflict over direction
- ❌ Loss of knowledge if leadership suddenly changes
- ❌ Family relationships strained over business decisions
- ❌ Ecosystem at risk if no one prepared to take over

**With Succession Planning, We Secure:**
- ✅ Clear authority and decision-making structure
- ✅ Prepared successor with demonstrated capability
- ✅ Gradual, low-risk transition to new leadership
- ✅ Family alignment and support for transition
- ✅ Business continuity and protection of assets
- ✅ Sustainable long-term family business model

### 1.2 - Succession Philosophy: Growth Not Crisis

**Our Approach:**
Solo's succession is **planned, gradual development** - not emergency replacement.

```
SUCCESSION TIMELINE PHILOSOPHY

PHASE 5B (Oct 22-Nov 10): Foundation & Testing
  └─ Solo learns ecosystem thoroughly
  └─ Tests competency through Level 2 testing
  └─ Demonstrates readiness and judgment

Phase 6+ (Nov 11-2026): Gradual Authority Increase
  └─ Solo makes more operational decisions
  └─ Mukurwe provides mentoring and oversight
  └─ Solo's responsibility grows with demonstrated competency
  └─ Family continues to see progress and capability

2026-2027: Full Transition (Future)
  └─ Solo takes increasing strategic role
  └─ Mukurwe transitions to advisory/oversight
  └─ Solo becomes primary decision maker
  └─ Smooth, planned leadership transition

2027+: Solo's Leadership (Long-term)
  └─ Solo as primary ecosystem steward
  └─ Mukurwe in advisory capacity
  └─ Prepared for eventual succession to next generation
  └─ Sustainable family business model
```

**Core Principle:** 
> **Quality over speed. Solo's success matters more than how fast the transition happens.**

## Part 3: Solo's Current Authority & Constraints

### 3.1 - Authority Levels (Phase 5B)

**During Phase 5B Week 2 (Oct 28-Nov 1):**

| Authority Type | Decision Scope | Solo Authority | Process |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strategic** | Long-term direction, major initiatives | None (advisory only) | Solo recommends, Mukurwe decides |
| **Tactical** | Feature planning, resource allocation | None (testing input only) | Solo provides findings, Mukurwe decides |
| **Operational** | Bug fixes, maintenance, routine tasks | None (testing and learning) | Solo learns procedures, Mukurwe decides |

**In Plain English:**
- ✅ Solo can **test** and **learn** and **recommend**
- ✅ Solo can **identify** issues and **document** findings
- ✅ Solo can **ask questions** and **request guidance**
- ❌ Solo cannot **make decisions** during Phase 5B
- ❌ Solo cannot **implement changes** without Mukurwe approval
- ❌ Solo cannot **override** Mukurwe's decisions

**All Decisions Require Mukurwe's Approval**

### 3.2 - Decision Authority After Phase 5B (Post-Nov 10)

**Projected Authority Increase (Subject to demonstrated competency):**

| Timeline | Operational Authority | Tactical Authority | Strategic Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 5B (Oct 28-Nov 1)** | None - learning | Input only | None |
| **Nov 11-Dec 31** | Low (minor bug fixes) | Input + recommendations | None |
| **Jan-Mar 2026** | Medium (small updates) | Consultative | None |
| **Apr+ 2026** | Significant (most operations) | Joint decisions | Advisory input |
| **Future transition** | Full (day-to-day) | Full (feature decisions) | Growing role |

**Note:** This timeline is **subject to demonstrated competency**. If Solo needs more time to learn, timeline adjusts. Quality > Speed.

### 3.3 - Decision-Making Constraints

**Solo must escalate to Mukurwe if:**
- [ ] Any critical or high-severity issue found
- [ ] Uncertainty about impact or severity level
- [ ] Recommendation that requires resources or changes
- [ ] Anything involving family or business strategy
- [ ] Any decision that feels above their pay grade
- [ ] If someone else disagrees with their recommendation

**Safe Escalation Rule:**
> **When in doubt, ask Mukurwe. Better to over-escalate than to miss something important.**

**Escalation Process:**
1. Solo identifies issue or question
2. Solo prepares clear description (what, why, impact, recommendation)
3. Solo schedules time with Mukurwe (can be same day for urgent)
4. Solo explains issue and recommendation
5. Mukurwe makes decision
