## 📊 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Data Structure Changes

**Updated Contact Interface** (3 files updated):
```typescript
interface Contact {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // NEW: Sonny Network Integration Fields
  isHouseholdMember?: boolean;       // Lives in same household
  isFamilyMember?: boolean;          // From family tree
  sonnyRole?: 'monitor' | 'monitored' | 'both' | 'none';  // Sonny network role
  familyTreeId?: string;             // Links to family member ID
}
```

**Files Updated**:
1. `src/pages/intranet/contacts.tsx` - Main page interface
2. `src/components/contacts/ContactForm.tsx` - Form interface
3. `src/components/contacts/ContactCard.tsx` - Card display interface

### State Management

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [showFamilyImport, setShowFamilyImport] = useState(false);
const [filterSonnyRole, setFilterSonnyRole] = useState<string>('all');
const [filterHousehold, setFilterHousehold] = useState<boolean | null>(null);
const [filterFamily, setFilterFamily] = useState<boolean | null>(null);
```

**Filter Logic**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let filtered = contacts;
  
  // Apply all filters including new Sonny filters
  if (filterSonnyRole !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => c.sonnyRole === filterSonnyRole);
  }
  if (filterHousehold !== null) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => c.isHouseholdMember === filterHousehold);
  }
  if (filterFamily !== null) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(c => c.isFamilyMember === filterFamily);
  }
  
  setFilteredContacts(filtered);
}, [contacts, filterSonnyRole, filterHousehold, filterFamily]);
```
