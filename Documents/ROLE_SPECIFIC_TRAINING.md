### Feature Deep Dive

#### 1. Assigning Roles (Your Main Job)

**Why assign roles?**
- Everyone knows what they're responsible for
- Clear accountability
- Easy tracking of who did what
- Can follow up after event

**The 4 roles you assign:**

```
ORGANIZER 📋
  └─ Leads planning and execution
  └─ Full permissions
  └─ Can assign other roles
  └─ Can escalate incidents
  └─ Can edit event details
  └─ Can override decisions

PARTICIPANT 👤
  └─ Attends and participates
  └─ Limited permissions
  └─ Can't assign roles
  └─ Can offer assistance
  └─ Can report incidents

SUPPORTER 🤝
  └─ Provides resources or help
  └─ Limited permissions  
  └─ Can't assign roles
  └─ Primary role: offer assistance
  └─ Can report incidents

STEWARD 🛡️
  └─ Coordinates and oversees
  └─ High permissions (nearly like organizer)
  └─ Can assign roles (for Participants/Supporters)
  └─ Can escalate incidents
  └─ Can't delete event
  └─ Can override some decisions
```

**Best Practice: Who to assign each role?**

```
ORGANIZER:
  → Someone you trust completely
  → Should have backup organizer
  → Usually 1-2 people per event

STEWARD:
  → Lead helpers/coordinators
  → Usually 1-2 per 50 people
  → Give escalation authority to

PARTICIPANTS:
  → Everyone attending
  → Most people get this role
  → Can be upgraded to Supporter if needed

SUPPORTER:
  → People providing specific resources
  → Logistics coordinator
  → Helpers who need higher permissions
```

**Role Assignment Workflow:**

```
STEP 1: Open Event
  └─ Click calendar event
  └─ Look for "Assign Role" button

STEP 2: Search Person
  └─ Type their name
  └─ Click from dropdown
  └─ (They must be in your contacts/allowed list)

STEP 3: Select Role
  └─ Choose from 4 roles
  └─ Set permissions (can edit? can escalate?)
  └─ Optional: add notes ("Help with setup")

STEP 4: Send
  └─ Click "Assign Role"
  └─ They get notification
  └─ Status shows "Assigned"

STEP 5: Track
  └─ Status updates when they respond
  └─ Assigned → Accepted → Completed
  └─ Completed → Archive
```

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

❌ **DON'T** assign too many Organizers (gets confusing)
✅ **DO** have backup organizer if you'll be unavailable

❌ **DON'T** assign Organizer to everyone (security risk)
✅ **DO** use Participant for most people

❌ **DON'T** assign role and expect person to notice
✅ **DO** mention in person before sending role

❌ **DON'T** forget to monitor responses
✅ **DO** check "My Roles" tab weekly before event

---

#### 2. Incident Management (During Event)

**Your Role When Incident Reported:**
- Organizer gets notified IMMEDIATELY of critical incidents
- You have first decision-making authority
- You can escalate to Steward or Professional
- You log the incident (becomes permanent record)

**The 4 Severity Levels:**

```
🔴 CRITICAL
   ├─ Someone injured, ill, or in danger
   ├─ Safety issue (fire, weapon, etc.)
   ├─ Immediate escalation to professionals
   ├─ You must respond NOW
   └─ Example: "Someone passed out"

🟠 HIGH
   ├─ Serious problem needing supervisor
   ├─ Escalates within 15 minutes
   ├─ You or Steward must handle
   └─ Example: "Conflict between two people"

🟡 MEDIUM
   ├─ Problem that needs attention
   ├─ No auto-escalation
   ├─ You handle when available
   └─ Example: "Equipment not working"

🟢 LOW
   ├─ Minor issue
   ├─ Can wait for next check-in
   ├─ Staff will address
   └─ Example: "Coffee machine empty"
```

**When You Get a Critical Incident Alert:**

```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 60 seconds):
  1. Stop what you're doing
  2. Read incident details
  3. Look for reported location/person
  4. Assess: Is it still happening?
  5. If YES:
     └─ Get to location
     └─ Make sure person is safe
     └─ Call emergency (911) if needed
  6. If NO:
     └─ Contact person/witnesses
     └─ Document additional details
     └─ Update incident status

RESPONSE OPTIONS:
  - [Acknowledge] - I'm handling it
  - [Escalate] - Needs professional help
  - [Resolved] - Already fixed
  - [Request Help] - Need more people
```

**Pro Tips for Incident Management:**

✅ **Check incidents regularly** (every 30 minutes during event)
✅ **Respond quickly** to high severity items (within 15 min)
✅ **Document clearly** (updates help your team)
✅ **Escalate when unsure** (better safe than sorry)
✅ **Thank responders** (builds good team culture)
✅ **Review logs after** (learn for next event)

---

#### 3. Assistance Request Management

**Your New Capability: Help Your Team Get What They Need**

When someone posts "Need help with transportation," you can:
- See who offers to help
- Accept the best offer
- Track progress
- Confirm completion

**The Workflow:**

```
ASSISTANT REQUEST POSTED
  └─ "Need help setting up tables"

YOU REVIEW
  └─ See who offered
  └─ Choose best person
  └─ Accept their offer

HELPER CONFIRMED
  └─ They get notification
  └─ Status: In Progress
  └─ You can message them

COMPLETED
  └─ Helper marks done
  └─ Request auto-completes
  └─ You can thank them

TRACKING
  └─ All assistance logged
  └─ Can pull reports later
  └─ Great for recognizing helpers
```

**Best Practice: Maximize Assistance Requests**

✅ **Encourage your team** to post requests (don't struggle alone!)
✅ **Respond quickly** to offers (people get excited to help)
✅ **Be specific** in requests (clearer = better help)
✅ **Thank helpers** (recognition is powerful)
✅ **Document** who helped with what (recognize them later)

### Common Organizer Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Someone Doesn't Accept Role

**Problem:** Assigned John as Steward, he hasn't responded

**Solution:**
```
1. Wait 3 days
2. Click "Send Reminder"
3. If no response after 7 days:
   └─ Role auto-reverts to "Unconfirmed"
   └─ Either reassign or follow up in person
```

**Lesson:** Always have backup person in mind!

---

#### Scenario 2: Critical Incident During Event

**Problem:** Someone reports "Person having allergic reaction"

**What Happens:**
```
1. System sends you IMMEDIATE alert
2. Simultaneously alerts:
   └─ All Stewards
   └─ Emergency contact
   └─ On-call medical professional
3. You see options: [Acknowledged] [Escalate] [Resolved]
```

**What You Do:**
```
1. Read incident details (who, where, what)
2. Go to person's location
3. Assess situation
4. If emergency: call 911 immediately
5. Update status: [Acknowledged] or [Escalate]
6. Message responders: "Going to person now"
7. Follow up in incident: "Ambulance called, person stable"
```

**Key Point:** System helps, but YOU make decisions!

#### Scenario 3: Nobody Offers to Help With Setup

**Problem:** Posted "Need help setting up tables" - 0 offers after 1 hour

**What You Do:**
```
1. Go to Assistance Requests

4. Message specific people: "Can you help with setup?"
5. When they offer, accept their offer
6. Update request: [In Progress]
