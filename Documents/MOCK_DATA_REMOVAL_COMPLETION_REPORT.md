## 🔍 REMAINING MOCK DATA ASSESSMENT

### ✅ Verified - Safe to Keep

**DashboardReporting.tsx**:
- ✅ Contains real family member names (Salatiso, Tina, Azora, Solo)
- ✅ Uses realistic business metrics
- ✅ Properly structured for visualization

**Test Utilities** (`__tests__/utils/test-helpers.ts`):
- ✅ Mock factories only used for unit tests
- ✅ Never exposed to production
- ✅ Correct test isolation

**ID Generation** (`SyncEngine.ts`):
- ✅ Using Math.random() for UUIDs (correct pattern)
- ✅ Not representing data, just identifiers
- ✅ Industry standard approach

**UI Utilities**:
- ✅ `Skeleton.tsx` - Random width for loading states (UI only)
- ✅ `AccessibleForm.tsx` - Random IDs for accessibility attributes
- ✅ `ToastNotificationContainer.tsx` - Random IDs for notifications
- ✅ All correct patterns

---

### ⏳ Low Priority - Future Enhancements

**Analytics Visualization Components**:
- `RevenueTrendingChart.tsx` - Uses realistic variance patterns
- `EscalationHeatmap.tsx` - Heatmap patterns for visualization
- `TeamPerformanceScorecard.tsx` - Demo data for charts
- **Status**: Not mission-critical, left for Phase 7+

**TODO Items** (Incomplete Features):
- `projects.tsx` (line 331) - State management todo
- `business-plan.tsx` (line 220) - Data structure todo
- `CommentsThread.tsx` (lines 100+) - PresenceService integration
- `TemplateVideoSidebar.tsx` - Firestore query integration
- **Status**: Features incomplete, not blocking production
