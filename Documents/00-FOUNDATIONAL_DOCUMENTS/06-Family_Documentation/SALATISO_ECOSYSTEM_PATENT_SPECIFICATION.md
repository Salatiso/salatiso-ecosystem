## Executive Summary

This document provides the complete technical specification for the Salatiso Ecosystem patent application, covering a revolutionary decentralized personal value ledger system that transforms how individual contributions, skills, and experiences are recorded, verified, and monetized. The invention addresses fundamental limitations in current professional credentialing, personal data management, and value recognition systems by implementing a self-sovereign identity framework integrated with family value quantification and community-based validation.

### 1.3 Corporate Ownership and Governance Alignment (Company-First Structure)

To align technical claims with commercialization and governance, intellectual property (including patents, trademarks, and core protocols) is initially held by Mlandeli Notemba Investments (Pty) Ltd ("MNI"), the family holding company. MNI does not trade; all trading occurs via operational subsidiaries. The IP may be transferred in the future to a family trust via a market-value sale or structured loan to manage donations tax and CGT exposure. Subsidiaries license IP from MNI under standardized terms.

Key implications for the patent system description:
- IP Ownership: MNI listed as initial assignee; subsidiaries are licensees.
- Data Stewardship: LifeCV/LifeKey remain user-sovereign; corporate entities interact as Issuers/Verifiers per W3C DID/VC.
- Governance Hooks: The protocol surfaces "trust and contribution" signals (LifeCV) that inform corporate voting/benefit policies, without changing cryptographic primitives.

### 1.4 Engagement Model: Partnerships over Employment

The reference implementation adopts an entity-to-entity engagement model. Contributors operate through micro-enterprises that partner with subsidiaries; no employment contracts are required. The platform supports this via:
- Verifiable micro-agreements (scope, fee, endorsement, dispute) signed as VCs.
- Compliance proxy endorsements (registered professionals can validate outputs) to create compliant deliverables without mandatory formal registration for every contributor.
- Transparent audit trails with reciprocal endorsements to reduce labor-law entanglements while preserving accountability.

### 1.5 Non-Profit Embedded Architecture and Freemium Policy

Each application embeds a non-profit module providing free-for-life personal use as a public benefit service. The same codebase supports professional/enterprise features for paid use.

- Public Benefit Module: Structured for South African PBO/Section 18A eligibility where applicable, recording impact metrics (beneficiary counts, hours, educational outcomes) as verifiable credentials.
- Freemium Boundary: Personal accounts access core features at zero cost; professional, institutional, or commercial use unlocks premium features (advanced analytics, credential verification at scale, SLAs, integrations) via paid licenses.
- Data Integrity: Free access does not dilute verification quality; all flows use DID/VC and optional ZKPs.

### 1.6 Succession, Share Allocation, and Trust Transition Signals

The governance model interfaces with the platform via LifeCV-based contribution metrics:
- Base Allocation: Each direct descendant receives a base equity allocation at age 18 (default policy: 1% of issued capital or a fixed single share, depending on MOI/cap table design), recorded as a credential and linked to trustee/secretary attestations.
- Contribution Accumulation: Additional share grants or options can be periodically allocated based on verified LifeCV contributions and trust ratings, reviewed at defined intervals (e.g., annually).
- Trust Transition: Early transfer or licensing of IP to a family trust is supported. The system records transaction provenance (valuation, agreements) as credentials to support tax compliance and auditability.
