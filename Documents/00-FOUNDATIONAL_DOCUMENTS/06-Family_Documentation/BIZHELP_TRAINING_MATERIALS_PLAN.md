## 11. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Budget Overrun** | High | Medium | Phased rollout allows cost control; prioritize Phase 1-2 over 3-4 if needed |
| **Timeline Delays** | Medium | Medium | Build 1-week buffer per phase; nephew's test (Phase 1) is non-negotiable deadline |
| **Technical Inaccuracy** (legal/compliance) | High | Low | Round 3 expert review mandatory; include disclaimers to consult professionals |
| **Low User Adoption** | High | Low | Heavy integration with LifeCV proof system incentivizes usage; family testing ensures relevance |
| **Accessibility Barriers** | Medium | Medium | WCAG audit in Phase 4; large-print and audio versions for elders |
| **Outdated Content** | Medium | High | Quarterly update calendar; version control system; community flag system |
| **Brand Inconsistency** | Low | Medium | Design system and template library; approval workflow for all materials |
