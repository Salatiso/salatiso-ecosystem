## Welcome to Our Learning Community

**Welcome! You're accessing the public beta of the Salatiso Ecosystem through its live testing phase (running until December 31, 2025).** While we have robust security protocols in place to protect your data, you may see ongoing tweaks and improvements throughout the year.

We invite you to experiment freely, and for peace of mind during testing, we encourage you to use simulated or fictitious information in your LifeCV entries. That said, feel free to use real data if you wish—your participation helps us strengthen our security and reliability.

## Our Social Contract: Reciprocity in Action

All our tools are **free for you to use for your personal growth**. We do not charge for them, but we do ask for something in return: **reciprocity**.

This is a fundamental law of nature and community. Just as we offer you a helping hand, we ask that you extend yours to someone else. If these tools help you, pay it forward. Share your knowledge, contribute your expertise where you can, or simply show someone else where they can find help.
