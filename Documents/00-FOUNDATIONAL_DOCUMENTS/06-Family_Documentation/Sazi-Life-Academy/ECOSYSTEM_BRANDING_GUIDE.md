# Salatiso Ecosystem Branding Guide

## 1. Introduction & Core Philosophy

This document outlines the branding strategy for all applications within the Salatiso ecosystem. The primary goal is to create a unified, recognizable, and trusted brand identity while allowing each application to maintain its unique character.

The core principle is the unification of all app brands under the master Salatiso brand. This is achieved by consistently applying the **"by Salatiso"** tagline to each application's logo and branding materials. This enhancement reinforces the connection between the apps and the overarching ecosystem, building trust and brand equity.

The existing brand aesthetics, which are modern, clean, and user-friendly, should be preserved. The "by Salatiso" tagline is an enhancement, not a replacement.

## 2. The "by Salatiso" Logo Lockup

The official branding for any application in the ecosystem is a vertical lockup of the application's name and the Salatiso tagline.

### 2.1. Structure

The structure is fixed and should be replicated precisely:

1.  **Application Name:** The primary, most prominent element.
2.  **Tagline:** "by Salatiso", positioned directly below the Application Name.

**Visual Representation:**

```
+----------------------+
|                      |
|   [Application Name] |
|     by Salatiso      |
|                      |
+----------------------+
```

### 2.2. Typography

Consistency in typography is key to a professional look.

-   **Application Name Font:**
    -   **Font:** Use a bold, modern, clean sans-serif font. (e.g., Montserrat, Lato, Poppins, or system UI fonts).
    -   **Weight:** Bold (700) or Extra-Bold (800).
    -   **Case:** Title Case (e.g., `LifeSync`, `Pigeeback`).

-   **Tagline Font:**
    -   **Font:** Same font family as the Application Name.
    -   **Weight:** Light (300) or Regular (400).
    -   **Size:** The font size should be approximately **40-50%** of the Application Name's font size.
    -   **Case:** Sentence case ("by Salatiso").

### 2.3. Color Palette

The color palette should remain consistent with each app's established identity, with the tagline using a neutral or secondary color.

-   **Application Name Color:** Use the primary brand color of the specific application.
    -   *Example for LifeSync:* A vibrant blue (`#007BFF`) or teal.
-   **Tagline Color:** Use a neutral, less prominent color to ensure the Application Name stands out.
    -   **Primary Choice:** A medium-to-dark gray (e.g., `#4A4A4A` or `#6c757d`).
    -   **Secondary Choice:** A muted or darker shade of the application's primary color.

### 2.4. Spacing & Sizing

The relationship between the elements must be consistent.

-   **Vertical Spacing:** The space between the baseline of the **Application Name** and the top of the **"by Salatiso"** tagline should be **25-30%** of the height of the Application Name. This ensures a tight but readable lockup.
-   **Clear Space:** A minimum clear space (padding) equal to the height of the "by Salatiso" tagline should be maintained around the entire logo lockup to ensure its visibility and impact.

## 4. Usage in Application UI

To ensure a consistent user experience, the new branding should be applied in the following key areas of the application interface.

-   **Splash/Loading Screens:** The full logo lockup should be prominently displayed and centered on the screen during application startup.
-   **Headers & Navigation Bars:** The logo lockup should appear in the top-left corner of the main application header. On smaller screens, an icon version of the app logo can be used, but the full lockup should be visible on the main dashboard or home screen.
-   **Login/Onboarding Pages:** The logo lockup should be the primary visual element at the top of these pages to welcome the user.
-   **Footers:** The logo lockup can be used in the application footer, alongside copyright notices and links to other Salatiso properties.
-   **Marketing Materials & Emails:** All external communications should use the official logo lockup to maintain brand consistency.

By adhering to these guidelines, we will build a strong, cohesive, and trustworthy brand identity for the entire Salatiso ecosystem.
