# Sonny & LifeSync Technical Specification

**Owner:** MNI Core Infrastructure Council  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Active ‚Äî Core ecosystem infrastructure

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sonny is the **offline-first companion communications and safety backbone** of the Salatiso ecosystem. It is not a standalone app but the foundational infrastructure enabling trust, reciprocity, and dignity across all vertical applications (PigeeBack, eKhaya, SafetyHelp, Sazi Life Academy, Flamea, etc.).

At its core are two foundational services:
- **LifeCV** ‚Üí Portable, verifiable profile of identity, trust score, ratings, and roles
- **LifeSync** ‚Üí Synchronization engine ensuring reciprocal data exchange, offline-first propagation, and conditional online bridging

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Offline-First, Online-Optional
- **Default:** Bluetooth + Wi-Fi mesh
- **Internet:** Only when explicitly chosen or triggered by safety rules
- **No data costs:** Essential communications work without cellular data

### 2.2 Reciprocity by Design
- Every sync is two-way: if I store your safety data, you store mine
- Monitoring roles must be accepted, logged, and renewable
- All exchanges are mutual and consent-based

### 2.3 Trigger-Based Safety Automation
- Users define check-in triggers (trip start, mid-trip intervals, arrival)
- Missed triggers initiate escalation automatically
- Local escalation first (household/community offline), online as fallback

### 2.4 Trust Scoring
- Ratings, LifeCV history, and reciprocity logs build trust scores
- Higher trust = more reliable partners, safer rides, stronger communities
- Trust Score visible across all ecosystem apps

### 2.5 Consent as First Security Layer
- No one is monitored or visible without explicit opt-in
- Consent is time-boxed and renewable
- Immutable consent ledger tracks all permissions

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Core Services

#### LifeCV Service
- Identity management
- Trust score calculation
- Ratings & endorsements
- Role definitions (household, community, professional)
- Portable profile data structure

#### LifeSync Engine
- Offline-first sync via BLE/Wi-Fi mesh
- Gossip routing for message propagation
- Trigger management and timers
- Escalation logic
- Online bridge activation (when needed)

#### Trigger Manager
- User-defined safety rules
- Interval timers (15 min, 30 min, custom)
- Check-in tracking
- Escalation policies (local ‚Üí online)
- Reciprocal notification system

#### Consent Ledger
- Immutable log of roles, consents, expirations
- Renewal requests
- Revocation tracking
- Audit trail for trust disputes

---

## 4. Trigger & Check-In System

### 4.1 User-Defined Triggers

#### Trip Start Trigger
- User presses "Start Trip" button
- Arms all defined check-in requirements
- Syncs with reciprocal party (e.g., PigeeBack driver)
- Exchanges safety data bidirectionally

#### Mid-Trip Check-Ins
- Configurable intervals (e.g., every 15 min, at checkpoints)
- Automatic proximity pings to known contacts along route
- Manual "I'm OK" acknowledgments
- Location breadcrumbs (offline cached)

#### Arrival Trigger
- "Arrived" confirmation required at destination
- Household/emergency contacts notified
- Trip completion logged to LifeCV

### 4.2 Escalation Logic

```
IF check-in missed:
  1. Local escalation ‚Üí Household/community notified offline (mesh)
  2. Wait for secondary confirmation window
  3. IF still unresolved:
     ‚Üí Device sends data via internet (if available)
     ‚Üí Driver's details sent to rider's emergency contacts
     ‚Üí Rider's details sent to driver's emergency contacts
  4. Both sides follow up (assume accident/emergency)
```

### 4.3 Reciprocal Safety Exchange

**Example: PigeeBack Ride**
1. Rider syncs with driver offline (BLE/Wi-Fi)
2. Both phones exchange:
   - LifeCV profiles
   - Emergency contacts
   - Trip details (route, duration, checkpoints)
3. Rider sets check-in triggers (mid-trip + arrival)
4. If rider fails to check in:
   - Rider's emergency contacts receive driver's details
   - Driver's emergency contacts receive rider's details
   - Trust scores updated based on outcome

---

## 5. Trust & Safety Layers

### Layer 1: Consent
- Entry into ecosystem requires explicit consent
- Users define who monitors them and whom they monitor
- Consent can be revoked at any time

### Layer 2: Reciprocity
- Every monitoring or data exchange is mutual
- No one-sided surveillance
- Data stored on both parties' devices

### Layer 3: Trust Score (LifeCV)
Built from:
- **Ratings:** Rides, visits, community contributions
- **Check-in history:** Reliability of confirmations
- **Reciprocity logs:** Successful mutual exchanges
- **Endorsements:** From trusted nodes

### Layer 4: Escalation & Accountability
- Automatic escalation ensures no one disappears silently
- Reciprocal notifications prevent one-sided blame
- Audit trail for disputes or incidents

---

## 6. Sonny Network Capabilities

### 6.1 Presence & Range Detection
- Automatic detection when known contacts enter range
- Notifications: "Jane is nearby"
- Configurable visibility (friends/family/community/public)

### 6.2 Offline Messaging
- **In-range:** Text, voice, video (WiFi quality dependent)
- **Out-of-range:** Messages parked locally
- **Delivery:** Automatic when contact returns to range

### 6.3 Community Postbox (Gossip Routing)
- User posts announcement to community
- Message propagates peer-to-peer as users move
- Each phone becomes distribution node
- Hop count tracking
- Internet bridge option (if one household has connectivity)

**Example:**
```
Community announcement posted by User A
‚Üí Syncs to Users B, C, D within range
‚Üí User B walks to market, syncs with Users E, F, G
‚Üí User C has internet, bridges message online to remote members
‚Üí Eventually all 100 community members receive message
```

### 6.4 Status Broadcasting
Users set offline status:
- üü¢ Looking for friends
- üíº Business networking
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Romantic connections (consent-based matching)
- üè† Housing/roommate search

As users walk, others scan for compatible statuses within range.
