# Ecosystem Contact Management Standard

## Overview

The Ecosystem Contact Management Standard establishes a unified approach to handling contacts across all Salatiso ecosystem applications. This standard ensures consistent contact data structures, enhanced user experiences through intelligent forms, seamless family tree integration, Sonny role assignments, and powerful filtering capabilities. Contacts serve as the foundation for trust relationships, communication, and ecosystem-wide interactions.

## Core Principles

1. **Unified Data Model**: All contacts follow a standardized schema with extensible fields
2. **Privacy-First**: Contact data is encrypted and access-controlled via Five-Level Progression
3. **Offline-First**: Contact management works seamlessly offline with CRDT synchronization
4. **Trust Integration**: Contacts are linked to Sonny trust scores and role assignments
5. **Family-Centric**: Native support for family tree structures and relationships
6. **AI-Enhanced**: Intelligent contact suggestions and data enrichment

## Contact Data Model

### Base Contact Schema

```typescript
interface Contact {
  id: string;
  primaryName: string;
  displayName: string;
  contactType: 'individual' | 'organization' | 'family';
  trustScore: number; // Sonny trust score 0-100
  progressionLevel: number; // Five-Level Progression
  sonnyRoles: SonnyRole[];
  familyTree?: FamilyTree;
  contactMethods: ContactMethod[];
  addresses: Address[];
  metadata: ContactMetadata;
  created: Date;
  lastModified: Date;
  syncedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Contact Types

- **Individual**: Single person contacts with personal details
- **Organization**: Business or group entities with multiple representatives
- **Family**: Hierarchical family structures with relationship mapping

## Enhanced Contact Forms

### Intelligent Form Features

1. **Auto-Suggestion**: AI-powered contact suggestions based on context and relationships
2. **Smart Validation**: Real-time validation with format detection and data enrichment
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Forms adapt based on contact type and user progression level
4. **Multi-Modal Input**: Support for voice, text, and visual contact capture
5. **Relationship Mapping**: Automatic relationship detection and family tree building

### Form Components

#### Primary Contact Form

```typescript
interface ContactFormProps {
  contactType: ContactType;
  onSubmit: (contact: Partial<Contact>) => Promise<void>;
  enableSonnyIntegration: boolean;
  familyTreeContext?: FamilyTree;
}
```

#### Family Tree Import

- **CSV Import**: Bulk import family relationships from spreadsheets
- **GEDCOM Support**: Standard genealogy file format integration
- **Social Media Integration**: Import family connections from connected platforms
- **Manual Relationship Builder**: Visual drag-and-drop relationship mapping

## Sonny Role Integration

### Role Assignment System

Contacts can be assigned specific roles within the Sonny trust network:

- **Guardian**: Trusted family member with oversight capabilities
- **Mentor**: Experienced user providing guidance and support
- **Emergency Contact**: Designated for crisis communication
- **Service Provider**: Verified professionals (doctors, teachers, etc.)
- **Community Leader**: Recognized community representatives

### Role-Based Permissions

```typescript
interface SonnyRole {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  trustThreshold: number;
  scope: 'family' | 'community' | 'ecosystem';
}
```

## Filtering and Search System

### Advanced Filtering Options

1. **Trust Score Range**: Filter contacts by Sonny trust levels
2. **Relationship Type**: Family, professional, community connections
3. **Geographic Proximity**: Location-based contact discovery
4. **Progression Level**: Filter by Five-Level Progression status
5. **Activity Status**: Active, inactive, or archived contacts
6. **Custom Tags**: User-defined categorization system

### Search Capabilities

- **Full-Text Search**: Across all contact fields and metadata
- **Semantic Search**: AI-powered meaning-based search
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Approximate name and detail matching
- **Relationship Queries**: "Find contacts related to X" functionality

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### Contact Management

```
POST   /api/contacts              # Create new contact
GET    /api/contacts/{id}         # Retrieve contact
PUT    /api/contacts/{id}         # Update contact
DELETE /api/contacts/{id}         # Archive contact
GET    /api/contacts/search       # Search contacts
POST   /api/contacts/import       # Bulk import
```

#### Family Tree Operations

```
POST   /api/family-trees           # Create family tree
GET    /api/family-trees/{id}     # Get family tree
PUT    /api/family-trees/{id}     # Update relationships
POST   /api/family-trees/{id}/import # Import GEDCOM/family data
```

#### Sonny Integration

```
POST   /api/contacts/{id}/roles    # Assign Sonny roles
GET    /api/contacts/{id}/trust   # Get trust score
POST   /api/contacts/trust-update # Update trust scores
```

### Database Schema

#### Contacts Collection (Firestore)

```typescript
interface FirestoreContact extends Contact {
  _searchIndex: string[]; // For full-text search
  _geohash: string; // For geographic queries
  _vectorEmbedding: number[]; // For semantic search
}
```

#### Family Trees Collection

```typescript
interface FamilyTree {
  id: string;
  rootContactId: string;
  relationships: Relationship[];
  metadata: {
    importedFrom?: 'gedcom' | 'csv' | 'manual';
    lastValidated: Date;
  };
}
```

## Integration Points

### Ecosystem App Integration

All ecosystem apps must implement contact management through shared libraries:

- **LifeSync**: Core contact synchronization and offline storage
- **DocHelp**: Contact-aware document generation and sharing
- **PubHelp**: Contact-based publishing and distribution
