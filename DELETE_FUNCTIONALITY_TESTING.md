## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Delete button doesn't work / nothing happens
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for JavaScript errors (red text)
3. Try again with browser console open
4. Share any error messages

### Issue 2: Contact deleted but still shows in list
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh page: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Check Firestore - is `isDeleted: true` set?
3. If Firestore shows `isDeleted: true` but UI still shows contact, there's a caching issue

### Issue 3: Recycle Bin button missing or doesn't work
**Solution:**
1. Check if you're logged in
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify you have deleted at least one contact
4. Try refreshing the page

### Issue 4: Error: "permission-denied"
**Solution:**
1. This is a Firestore security rules issue
2. Check that contact has `addedBy: your-user-id`
3. Verify Firestore rules allow `addedBy == request.auth.uid`
4. Check browser console for exact error message
5. Share the full error message

### Issue 5: Contact won't restore
**Solution:**
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify Firestore shows `isDeleted: true` before restore
3. After restore, verify `isDeleted: false` in Firestore
4. Try hard refresh
5. Share console error message

## üìû How to Report Issues

When reporting a delete issue, please provide:

1. **Exact steps to reproduce:**

   1. Open contacts page
   2. Click delete on contact named "John Doe"

   ```

2. **Browser console output (F12):**
   - Copy/paste all red error text

   - Include error code if present

3. **Firestore state:**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
   - Find the contact by name

- Recycle Bin load: ~500ms (Firestore query)
- Restore: ~500-1000ms (Firestore update)
