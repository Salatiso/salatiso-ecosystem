## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Added to contacts.tsx
const [selectedContacts, setSelectedContacts] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [bulkDeleteConfirm, setBulkDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);

// Helper functions
const toggleSelectContact = (contactId: string) => { ... }
const toggleSelectAll = () => { ... }
```

### Handler Functions
1. **handleBulkDelete** - Deletes from Firestore + updates UI
2. **handleBulkExport** - Generates CSV + triggers download
3. **handleBulkAddTag** - Updates all contacts with new tag
4. **toggleSelectContact** - Manages selection state
5. **toggleSelectAll** - Selects/deselects all on page

### Component Updates
- **ContactCard.tsx** - Added checkbox + isSelected props
- **ContactListView.tsx** - Already supports multi-select
- **ContactTableView.tsx** - Already supports multi-select

### Firestore Operations
- All bulk operations are atomic per-contact
- Uses `updateContact()` for tag additions
- Uses `deleteContact()` for deletions
- Updates reflected in local state for instant UI feedback
