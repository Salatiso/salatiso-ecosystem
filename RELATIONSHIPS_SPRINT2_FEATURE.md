  relationships: Relationship[];       // Current relationships
  onAddRelationship: (rel) => void;   // Add handler
  onRemoveRelationship: (type, id) => void;  // Remove handler
  compact?: boolean;                  // Compact mode flag
}

interface Relationship {
  type: 'spouse' | 'child' | 'parent' | 'sibling' | 'friend' | 'colleague' | 'other';
  contactId: string;
  contactName: string;
}
```

  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "relationships": [
    {
      "label": "Spouse",
      "value": "Jane Doe"
    },
