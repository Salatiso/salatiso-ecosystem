## 🎨 Feature 1: Smart Contact Suggestions

### What It Does
Analyzes all contacts in your system and suggests related people based on:
- **🔴 Same Surname** - Potential family members (85%+ name match)
- **🔵 Same Address** - Potential household members (same location)
- **🟣 Same Email Domain** - Potential colleagues (same organization)

### How It Works
1. `ContactSuggestionService` calculates similarity scores
2. Shows up to 3 suggestions on each contact card
3. Compact view: Expandable widget below contact notes
4. Click suggestion to open related contact
5. Confidence score shown (0-100%)

### Files Created
- `src/services/ContactSuggestionService.ts` (Already existed, used as-is)
- `src/components/contacts/SmartSuggestions.tsx` (NEW)

### Files Modified
- `src/components/contacts/ContactCard.tsx` - Integrated suggestions
- `src/pages/intranet/contacts.tsx` - Pass contacts to CardCard for suggestions

### UI Example
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ John Doe                                │
│ john@example.com | (555) 123-4567      │
│                                         │
│ Note: CEO of Acme Corp                 │
│                                         │
│ You might know                      ▼  │
│ └─ Jane Doe - Family 95%              │
│ └─ Bob Smith - Household 90%          │
│ └─ Alice Johnson - Organization 75%   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Performance
- Calculated on component mount
- Cached per contact
- Shows instantly after first render
- Max 3 suggestions (configurable)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Suggestions Component
```typescript
interface SmartSuggestionsProps {
  contact: Contact;
  allContacts: Contact[];
  onContactClick: (contact: Contact) => void;
  maxSuggestions?: number;     // Default: 3
  compact?: boolean;            // Default: false
}
```

**Features**:
- Compact expandable view (toggles with arrow)
- Full expanded view (all 3 suggestions visible)
- Icons show suggestion type (family, household, colleague)
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Click to open suggested contact

### View Format System
```typescript
type ViewFormat = 'grid' | 'list' | 'table';
const [viewFormat, setViewFormat] = useState<ViewFormat>('grid');
```

**Benefits**:
- User preference saves in component state
- Persistence possible via localStorage (future)
- Instant switching (no page reload)
- All filters/sort apply to any view
- Pagination works across all views

### Integration Points

## 📚 User Guide

### Using Smart Suggestions

2. **Expand**: Click arrow to show all suggestions
3. **Understand**: Read reason for suggestion (surname, address, etc.)
4. **Navigate**: Click a suggestion to open that contact
5. **Verify**: Check confidence score (95% = very likely, 65% = could be)

### Switching Views
1. **Find Toggle**: Top right area of contacts page
2. **Grid** (🔲): Default, card view, visual browsing
3. **List** (📝): Row view, text-focused, compact

## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Smart Suggestions?
> Helps users discover family members, household members, and colleagues they may have forgotten to connect. Reduces duplicate entries and helps understand contact networks.

### Why Multiple Views?
> Different users have different needs:
> - Visual people → Grid
> - Detail-focused → List
> - Data analysts → Table
> Providing all three maximizes usability.

### Why Compact by Default?
> Keeps contact cards clean and focused. Suggestions visible but not dominant. Can expand if user interested in discovering connections.

### Why Toggle, Not Selector Dropdown?
> Icons are faster to scan and click than dropdowns. Three options fit naturally in header. Visual feedback (gold highlight) shows current view instantly.

## 📞 Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Suggestions read-only**: Can view but not act on suggestions
2. **No merging**: Can't merge suggested contacts automatically
3. **No relationship saving**: Suggestions are temporary
4. **View preference not saved**: Resets on page refresh
5. **No bulk operations yet**: Can't select multiple contacts

### Planned Enhancements
1. Save view preference to localStorage
2. Add "Connect" button to suggestions → create relationship
3. Implement bulk operations (delete, tag, export)
4. Add image upload per contact
5. Create detailed contact modal
6. Backup & restore functionality
