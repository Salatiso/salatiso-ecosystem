**Deployment fails:**
- Check Firebase credentials: `firebase login`
- Check project config: `firebase use --list`
- Check Firestore rules: `firebase firestore:get /`

**Performance issues:**
- Check network tab in DevTools
- Check Firestore quota in Firebase console
- Check for unoptimized queries
