/**
 * PHASE 4 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY - CONTACT MANAGEMENT CENTRALIZATION
 * 
 * COMPLETED WORK (Tasks 1, 2, 9)
 * ================================
 * 
 * ✅ TASK 1: Extended ContactsService with Relationships
 * Location: src/services/ContactsService.ts
 * Changes:
 * - Added ContactRelationship interface for bidirectional relationships
 * - Expanded Contact interface with life status fields (status, dateOfBirth, residenceLocation, residenceType)
 * - Implemented addRelationship() with automatic bidirectional sync
 * - Implemented removeRelationship() with cascading inverse deletion
 * - Implemented getContactRelationships(), getRelatedContacts(), getRelationshipsByType()
 * - Added private getInverseRelationshipType() for automatic relationship inversion
 * - Added updateContactStatus() for marking contacts as deceased
 * - Added getFamilyMembers() and getHouseholdMembers() helper methods
 * 
 * Relationship Types Supported:
 * - parent, child, sibling, spouse, grandchild, grandparent
 * - friend, colleague, business_partner, mentor, mentee, other
 * 
 * Bidirectional Examples:
 * - parent ↔ child (opposite relationship automatically created)
 * - sibling ↔ sibling (same relationship on both sides)
 * - spouse ↔ spouse (same relationship on both sides)
 * - mentor ↔ mentee (opposite relationship automatically created)
 * 
 * ✅ TASK 2: Created Family Data Migration System
 * Files Created:
 * 1. src/data/migrateFamily.ts - Complete migration data
 *    - getMigrationContacts() - 13 family members as Contact objects
 *    - getMigrationRelationships() - 19 family relationships
 *    - validateRelationships() - Validation helper
 *    - ContactNameMap interface for ID tracking
 * 
 * 2. src/hooks/useFamilyMembers.ts - React hook for family data
 *    - useFamilyMembers() hook
 *    - Loads contacts from Firestore
 *    - Methods: loadMembers, updateMember, getRelatedMembers, getMembersByRelationship
 *    - Real-time sync ready
 * 
 * Family Members Migrated (13 total):
 * - Matriarch: Nozukile Cynthia Mdeni (Mother) - status: active
 * - Current Generation: Salatiso, Visa, Tina, Kwakho (4 siblings)
 * - Next Generation: Solo, Sazi, Azora, Mila, Milande, Milani (6 children)
 * - Ancestors: Sisiwe, Ndleleni - status: deceased
 * 
 * ✅ TASK 9: Added Deceased Contact Handling
 * Changes:
 * - Extended Contact.status type: 'active' | 'developing' | 'deceased' | 'unknown'
 * - Updated ContactsService.updateContactStatus()
 * - Supports querying deceased members
 * - Ready for UI implementation in contacts.tsx
 * 
 * 
 * READY FOR NEXT PHASE (Tasks 3-8)
 * ================================
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 3: Update Family Tree UI to Use ContactsService
 * Current State:
 * - family.tsx uses local useState with hardcoded member data
 * - No Firestore integration yet
 * - No real-time sync
 * 
 * Required Changes:
 * - Replace member state initialization with useFamilyMembers() hook
 * - Update component to load from Firestore on mount
 * - Implement real-time listeners for live updates
 * - Update member edit to use contactsService.updateContact()
 * - Remove hardcoded data array, replace with dynamic loading
 * - Update relationship visualization to show actual family tree from relationships
 * 
 * Files to Modify:
 * - src/pages/intranet/family.tsx (main family page)
 * - src/components/family/FamilyDataModel.tsx (data visualization)
 * 
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 4: Create RelationshipSyncService for App-Wide Updates
 * Purpose:
 * - Manage relationship updates across all features
 * - Sync changes from contacts → family, calendar, assets, projects
 * - Implement real-time propagation
 * 
 * Required Implementation:
 * - Create src/services/RelationshipSyncService.ts
 * - Implement Firestore listeners for contact/relationship changes
 * - Pub/sub pattern for feature notification
 * - Methods:
 *   - onContactUpdated() - notify all features of contact changes
 *   - onRelationshipAdded() - update dependent features
 *   - onRelationshipRemoved() - clean up dependent features
 *   - broadcastUpdate() - send updates to all listeners
 * 
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 5: Audit & Document Current Contact References (IN PROGRESS)
 * Components Identified:
 * - src/pages/intranet/calendar.tsx - Uses hardcoded mock events with family names
 * - src/pages/intranet/assets.tsx - References "Salatiso", "Visa" etc.
 * - src/data/realFinancialData.ts - Asset owners hardcoded
 * - src/pages/intranet/projects/ - Team members (TBD - need search)
 * - src/pages/intranet/business/ - Business contacts (TBD - need search)
 * - src/components/dashboard/SonnyWidgets.tsx - Uses familyMembers from Sonny
 * 
 * Audit Status:
 * - calendar.tsx: mockEvents contains hardcoded participant names
 * - assets.tsx: Needs investigation (search planned)
 * - projects/: Needs investigation (search planned)
 * - business/: Needs investigation (search planned)
 * 
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 6: Update Calendar to Use ContactsService
 * Current Data Sources:
 * - calendar.tsx line 56: mockEvents with hardcoded family names
 * - Event participants: ["Salatiso", "Visa", "Sazi", etc.] as strings
 * 
 * Required Changes:
 * - Load family members from useFamilyMembers() hook
 * - Store event participants as contact IDs instead of strings
 * - Update event creation to link to contacts
 * - Implement sync: contact changes → calendar updates
 * - Update participant display to use contact names from service
 * 
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 7: Update Assets to Use ContactsService
 * Current Data Sources:
 * - src/data/realFinancialData.ts - Asset owners hardcoded
 * - src/pages/intranet/assets.tsx - Displays asset ownership
 * 
 * Required Changes:
 * - Replace hardcoded owner names with contact IDs
 * - Load asset owners from ContactsService
 * - Update asset display to use contact name lookups
 * - Implement sync: when contact name changes → asset display updates
 * 
 * 
 * ⏳ TASK 8: Update Projects to Use ContactsService
 * Current State: NEEDS INVESTIGATION
 * Files to Search:
 * - src/pages/intranet/projects/
 * - src/pages/intranet/business/
 * - Any team member management components
 * 
 * Required Changes (Planned):
 * - Load team members from ContactsService
 * - Store relationships between projects and contacts
 * - Update project UI to use contact data
 * - Implement bidirectional sync
 * 
 * 
 * TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
 * ======================
 * 
 * Data Flow:
 * Firebase Firestore
 *   └─ contacts collection (13 family members)
 *   └─ contact_relationships collection (19+ relationships)
 * 
 * Service Layer:
 * - ContactsService.ts (core operations)
 *   - addContact, updateContact, deleteContact
 *   - addRelationship, removeRelationship, getRelationships
 *   - getFamilyMembers, getHouseholdMembers
 * 
 * - RelationshipSyncService.ts (planned - app-wide sync)
 *   - Listens for Firestore changes
 *   - Broadcasts to all consuming features
 *   - Maintains consistency across app
 * 
 * UI Layer:
 * - useFamilyMembers hook (family pages)
 * - useContacts hook (contacts page - existing)
 * - Feature-specific hooks (calendar, assets, projects)
 * 
 * 
 * DATABASE SCHEMA (Firestore)
 * ============================
 * 
 * Collection: contacts
 * {
 *   id: string (auto-generated)
 *   firstName: string
 *   lastName: string
 *   dateOfBirth: string (ISO format)
 *   status: 'active' | 'developing' | 'deceased' | 'unknown'
 *   isFamilyMember: boolean
 *   isHouseholdMember: boolean
 *   residenceLocation: string
 *   residenceType: 'permanent' | 'temporary' | 'visiting'
 *   // ... other contact fields
 *   createdAt: Timestamp
 *   updatedAt: Timestamp
 *   addedBy: string (user ID)
 * }
 * 
 * Collection: contact_relationships
 * {
 *   id: string (auto-generated)
 *   contactId: string (from contact)
 *   relatedContactId: string (to contact)
 *   type: 'parent' | 'child' | 'sibling' | ... (15 types)
 *   isBidirectional: boolean
 *   notes: string
 *   createdAt: Timestamp
 *   updatedAt: Timestamp
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS (Needed for Tasks 3-8)
 * =========================================
 * 
 * 1. Family Tree Display
 *    - Use bidirectional relationships to build visual tree
 *    - Show: parents, siblings, children, spouse
 *    - Deceased members marked with special styling
 * 
 * 2. Calendar Events
 *    - Event participants stored as contact IDs
 *    - Display names resolved from Firestore
 *    - Changes propagate via RelationshipSyncService
 * 
 * 3. Asset Ownership
 *    - Asset owners stored as contact IDs
 *    - Name lookups from ContactsService
 *    - Ownership changes reflect immediately
 * 
 * 4. Project Teams
 *    - Team members linked to contacts
 *    - Bidirectional: project ← → team member
 *    - Changes sync app-wide
 * 
 * 5. Household Management
 *    - householdMembers.ts links to contacts via contactId
 *    - Residence type matches contact data
 *    - Updates in contacts sync to household
 * 
 *
