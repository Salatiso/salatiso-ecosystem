## 🎯 PHASE 7+ RECOMMENDATIONS

**Optional Enhancements** (not blocking production):
1. Implement real-time Firestore listeners for live updates
2. Complete TODO implementations in advanced features
3. Add automatic data refresh on page focus
4. Implement push notifications for real-time events
5. Advanced export with Firestore data aggregation

**Not Required**:
- Analytics visualization components (working as-is)
- Test mocks (properly isolated, not exposed)
- ID generation patterns (correct patterns used)
