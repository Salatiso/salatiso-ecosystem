# 🎯 QUICK FIX SUMMARY - October 25, 2025

## Three Critical Issues - All Fixed! ✅

---

## 1️⃣ **Contact Import Parse Errors (Lines 123, 145, 295)**

**Problem**: 
```
Import Complete
264 contacts imported successfully
Errors:
  Line 123: Could not parse contact data
  Line 145: Could not parse contact data  
  Line 295: Could not parse contact data
```

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Improved CSV parser to handle edge cases
- ✅ Added support for multiple header name variations
- ✅ Better error messages with data summaries
- ✅ Added deduplication for emails/phones/tags

**File**: `src/components/contacts/ImportExport.tsx`

---

## 2️⃣ **Contact Update Fails (Household Members & Sonny Roles)**

**Problem**: 
```
Failed to update contact. Please try again.
```

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed Firestore Date object handling
- ✅ Automatic conversion to Timestamp objects
- ✅ Protected immutable fields (id, createdAt, addedBy)
- ✅ Proper field sanitization

**File**: `src/services/ContactsService.ts`

**What Now Works**:
- Edit household member status ✅
- Change Sonny network roles ✅
- Update any contact field ✅

---

## 3️⃣ **Dashboard Shows Mock Data Instead of Real Contacts**

**Problem**:
```
Family Activity
M Mock Family Member 1 - Parent - online
M Mock Family Member 2 - Child - online  
```

**Solution**:
- ✅ Connected to real Firestore data
- ✅ Replaced mock `useSonnyServices` hook
- ✅ Real-time contact loading
- ✅ Shows imported family members

**File**: `src/components/dashboard/SonnyWidgets.tsx`

**What Now Works**:
- Dashboard shows imported contacts ✅
- Real names appear instead of "Mock Family Member" ✅
- Household classification displayed ✅
- Link to add more family members ✅
