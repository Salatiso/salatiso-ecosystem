## 🔐 Access Control & Data Sharing

### Cross-Module Authorization

```typescript
// Role-based access to modules
const moduleAccessRules = {
  'executive': ['governance', 'human-capital', 'operations', 'finance', 'marketing', 'reporting'],
  'finance-manager': ['finance', 'reporting'],
  'hr-manager': ['human-capital', 'operations', 'reporting'],
  'operations-manager': ['operations', 'reporting'],
  'team-member': ['own-profile', 'projects'],
};

// Field-level access control
const fieldAccessRules = {
  'salary': ['executive', 'finance-manager', 'hr-manager'],
  'personal-email': ['own-profile', 'hr-manager'],
  'audit-log': ['executive', 'auditor'],
  'strategy': ['executive', 'governance'],
};
```

### Data Isolation Strategy

```
Company Data Scope:
├── companies/{companyId}/
│   ├── Public (visible to all company members)
│   ├── Internal (visible to authenticated members)
│   └── Confidential (visible to authorized roles)
│
Specialized App Scope:
