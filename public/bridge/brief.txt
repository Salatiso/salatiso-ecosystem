I need you to help me design a bridge static html site like https://safetyfirst.help/; this site will be hosted on salatiso.com and will be the bridge between the old and th new site, shwoign the grownth and transition , so on landing the user must have clear option to go to the new web app or the old site hosted on https://salatiso.com/salatiso/


The page is great but lets improve it, 

We also need to update the https://salatiso-lifecv.web.app/journey/; I am much more interest in the human (65%) then the proffessioanl; the history that precceeded what is to give context, for example in the homeschooling father i make an example that my father used to walk to school barefoot, ive never been without shoes, that progress,  first the colour scheme must be alsigned twith both the salatiso.com/salatiso and the react ap to show this is a bridge.

At the bottommof the page lets have a carousel like https://flamea.org/publications.html of the bnooks including brief summaries and links to purchase sites 

While keeping the story on the bridge page brief because it must be updated on the web app 

The story on the bridge is not just about websites or apps, not just about my proffesisoanl career but holistic startic from the individual to proffessional. I wantt people to take pride in themselves, knwo that eve when they dont have formal qualifications they have knwoledge adn expertise which is suefull. I dont want to define myself by my proffessional or academic acheivements, yes i got them but they were merely the means, there's always beeen one end; being a father to my son, and the successor my father wanted me to be for my family. 

We need to weave the story that shows even the most rural of us can rise then go and learn in the formal systems then bring those skills back to the roots to enance the lives of those coming after, the ecossytem provides people with teh tools to empower themselves, provides safety features i wish i would have had, pigeeback ensure ride sharing, parcel delivery can be done everywhere especially where needed most, sonny ensure commnuication can be done low cos t includign for emergency and so on https://flamea.org/research.html https://flamea.org/Publications/Flamea_Research_&_Advocacy-Systemic%20Failures%20in%20South%20African_Family_Law.html

Then I need tou to review the content of the page because currently it focuses too much on the journey of web development byt the journey is not of web development but that of me https://salatiso-lifecv.web.app/about/ https://salatiso-lifecv.web.app/journey/
How Experience Became an Ecosystem
Every season of work, advocacy, and writing added another building block. This timeline captures the progression from hands-on OHS practice to open-source knowledge and finally to the interconnected platforms that run today.

The current content on https://salatiso-lifecv.web.app/journey/ thsi si grosly inacurrate and we need to fix it oi tthe web app as well, I have provided you with my books especially the homesciooling father and the safety first book which show relevant jhourneys i need you to intergrate; the beginign sin transkei are key to the storey, the family and schiolling from mahasana to lenance to kiriyatswana and so on, these are all critical including my journey for formal schooling, what i went through, from 18 my independendence from my parents and ability to provide from 21. The aspiration towards law studu=ies, actually studdiying it and dropout, I take pride in dropping out of the law because the judiciary is corrupt and no longer stands for the constitutiin as per my personal journey in the research and other documentaiton
