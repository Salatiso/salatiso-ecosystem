## 📚 SERVICES REFERENCE

### How to Use These Services

```typescript
// Import services
import roleService from '@/services/roleService';
import permissionService from '@/services/permissionService';
import contentFilterService from '@/services/contentFilterService';
import ageRoutingService from '@/services/ageRoutingService';

// Example 1: Check user role
const userRole = await roleService.getUserPrimaryRole(userId);
console.log(`User role: ${userRole?.name}`);

// Example 2: Verify permission
const hasViewAccess = await permissionService.hasPermission(userId, 'view_all');
if (hasViewAccess) {
  // Allow content access
}

// Example 3: Filter content
const accessibleContent = await contentFilterService.filterAccessibleContent(
  userId,
  allContent,
  { includeRestricted: true }
);

// Example 4: Route by age
const appropriatePath = await ageRoutingService.routeByAge(userId);
// Returns: '/kids/toddler' or '/kids/content' or '/intranet/learning' or '/intranet/dashboard'
```
