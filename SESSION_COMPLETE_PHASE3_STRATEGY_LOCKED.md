## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY ESTABLISHED

### Pattern for All Future Phases:

```
Development → Build → Test → Deploy → Verify → Next Phase
```

### Key Rules:
1. ✅ Always build before deploying: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Always verify build succeeds: "✓ Compiled successfully"
3. ✅ Always test URLs after deploy
4. ✅ Always commit before deploying
5. ✅ Always tag phase completions

### Deployment Commands:

| Phase | Command | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Phase 3 | `firebase deploy --only hosting` | 🔄 Ready |
| Phase 4 | `firebase deploy --only hosting,functions` | ⏳ Next |
| Phase 5 | `firebase deploy --only hosting` | ⏳ After 4 |
| Phase 6 | `firebase deploy` | ⏳ After 5 |
