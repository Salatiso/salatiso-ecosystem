## ⚠️ POTENTIAL RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Stick to feature list, prioritize ruthlessly

### Risk: Testing Delays
**Mitigation**: Write tests as you code, use testing templates

### Risk: Performance Issues
**Mitigation**: Profile early, optimize incrementally, monitor metrics

### Risk: Team Blockers
**Mitigation**: Daily standups, pair programming, mentor support

### Risk: Schedule Slip
**Mitigation**: Honest reporting, add buffer, prioritize features
