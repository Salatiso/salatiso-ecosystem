## ✨ KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Intelligent Matching
```typescript
// Surname matching with fuzzy logic
const similarity = calculateSimilarity("Smith", "Smyth"); // 85%

// Address matching with city extraction
const sameCity = addressesMatch(
  ["123 Main St, New York, NY"],
  ["456 Park Ave, New York, NY"]
); // true
```

### 2. Batch Operations
```typescript
// Efficient Firestore batch operations
const contactIds = await contactsService.addContactsBatch([
  contact1, contact2, contact3 // ... all saved atomically
]);
```

### 3. Token-Based Invitations
```typescript
// Secure 30-day expiring tokens
const invitation = await invitationService.sendEmailInvitation(contact);
// Token: "1729695840000-ab3c2d1ef"
// Expires: 30 days from now
```

### 4. Duplicate Prevention
```typescript
// Detect duplicates before import
const duplicates = duplicateDetectionService.findDuplicates(
  newContact, 
  existingContacts
); // [{confidence: 95, reason: "Email match", ...}]
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ Implemented
- Firestore rules enforce user ownership
- Invitation tokens are unique and time-limited
- Email normalization prevents injection
- All operations require authentication
- Atomic batch operations prevent inconsistency
- No sensitive data in browser storage

### 📋 Firestore Rules Applied
```
- Users can only see their own contacts
- Users can only edit their own contacts
- Invitations linked to sender ID
- Audit trail in collection timestamps
```

## 🎓 DEVELOPER NOTES

### Key Algorithms

**Levenshtein Distance** (String Similarity)
- Used for name and city matching
- Time complexity: O(n*m)
- Returns 0-100% similarity

**Normalized Comparison** (Email/Phone)
- Email: lowercase + trim
- Phone: digits only
- Ensures accurate matching regardless of formatting

**Weighted Confidence Scoring**
- Email match: +40 points
- Phone match: +35 points
- Name match: +25 points
- Address match: +20 points
- Threshold: 50% minimum
