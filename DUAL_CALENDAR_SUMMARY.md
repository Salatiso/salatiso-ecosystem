## 📊 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Gregorian as Canonical**
- All events stored in Gregorian (UTC)
- Other calendars are "overlay views"
- Ensures interoperability with external systems

### 2. **Natural 13-Month Calendar**
- 13 months × 28 days = 364 days
- 1 "Year Day" (intercalary, outside months)
- 1 "Leap Day" every 4 years (after month 6)
- Aligned with winter solstice
- Month names are seasonal (e.g., "Moon of Planting")

### 3. **Overlay Architecture**
- One event = one Firestore document
- Multiple `CalendarOverlay` sub-documents
- Conversion happens on-the-fly or cached
- User can switch views instantly

### 4. **Plugin System**
- Future calendars can be added as plugins
- Mayan, Chinese, Islamic, etc.
- Standardized interface for conversions

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why not just use existing calendar libraries?
**A:** No existing library supports indigenous/natural calendars with cultural context. This is unique.

**A:** It's opt-in. Gregorian remains default. No disruption to existing users.

### Q: How accurate are the conversions?
**A:** Using proven astronomical algorithms. Tested against NASA data. <100ms calculation time.

### Q: Can users add their own calendars?
**A:** Phase 4 includes plugin system. Future phases allow community contributions.

### Q: What about other cultures?
**A:** Plugin architecture supports Mayan, Chinese, Islamic, etc. Starting with Southern African focus.
