## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS**

1. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy after each sprint (not wait until end)
2. **Firestore Rules**: Update rules with each sprint for new collections
3. **Service Layer First**: Build services before components (DDD pattern)
4. **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript, strict mode
5. **Real-time First**: Use Firestore subscriptions where possible
6. **Mobile First**: Build mobile-responsive from start

---

## **READY TO BEGIN?**

I'm set up to:
1. Create detailed planning docs for Sprint 4A
2. Build services systematically
3. Create components with full TypeScript
4. Update Firestore rules
5. Build & deploy after each sprint

**Let's start Sprint 4A right now!**
