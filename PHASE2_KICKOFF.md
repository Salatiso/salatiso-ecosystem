## 📊 Implementation Template

### For Each Component

#### Step 1: Import Hook
```typescript
import { useBizHelpIntegration } from '@/hooks/useBizHelpIntegration';
import { ACTIVITY_TYPES } from '@/services/bizHelpIntegration';
```

#### Step 2: Get Logger
```typescript
export const ComponentName = ({ companyId }: Props) => {
  const { activityLogger } = useBizHelpIntegration(companyId);
  
  // Component code...
};
```

#### Step 3: Log Activities
```typescript
const handleCreate = async (data) => {
  try {
    const result = await createItem(data);
    
    // Log activity
    await activityLogger?.log(
      ACTIVITY_TYPES.ITEM_CREATED,
      {
        itemId: result.id,
        itemName: result.name,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        createdBy: userId
      }
    );
    
    showSuccess('Item created and logged');
  } catch (error) {
    showError('Failed to create item');
  }
};
```

#### Step 4: Test Activity Logging
```typescript
// Test: Verify activity was logged
const activities = await getActivitiesFromFirestore(userId);
expect(activities).toContainEqual(
  expect.objectContaining({
    type: ACTIVITY_TYPES.ITEM_CREATED,
    source: 'MNI'
  })
);
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ActivityFeedWidgetProps {
  companyId: string;
  maxItems?: number;

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test each component's logging
describe('CompanyProfileCard Activity Logging', () => {
  it('logs activity when profile is created', async () => {
    // Setup
    // Action
    // Assert activity logged
  });
  
  it('logs activity with correct data structure', async () => {
    // Verify activity has all required fields
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test cross-app sync
describe('Bi-Directional Activity Sync', () => {
  it('activity created in MNI visible in BizHelp', async () => {
    // Create activity in MNI
    // Wait for sync
    // Verify in BizHelp Firestore
  });
  
  it('sync latency < 50ms', async () => {
    // Measure time from activity creation to visibility
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests
```typescript
// Test complete workflows
describe('End-to-End Activity Logging', () => {
  it('complete project lifecycle logs all activities', async () => {
    // Create project
    // Update status
    // Complete project
    // Verify all activities logged in correct order
  });
});
```
